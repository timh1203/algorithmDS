5) understand difference between Divide & Conquer and Dynamic Programming
6) pros and cons of Greedy technique
7) recursive brute force algorithm

## B) Space & Time Complexity

---

### Introducing Space & Time Complexity (4/13/19)
https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/introducing-space-time-complexity/
- TOPICS: time complexity, space complexity, algorithmic speed

- time complexity is how we reason about the speed of an algorithm
- this allows us to process more data
- we can measure time exactly but we have a general nomenclature

- *space complexity* is how much memory is used
- *time complexity* is how many primitive operations are executed with respect to input size and assuming worst case scenarios

- PROBLEM: given a list of hotels, return the price range of hotels in a given search result
- we'd expect that the more data we have, the longer it will take to figure out the min and max required for the range
- as dataset grows, the cost can grow really fast or slow

- APPROACH #1: Compare all numbers to one another
- *quadratic time*: if we have 3 hotels, it's 9 operations
- ANSWER: we call this n^2, where n is the number of hotels. As n grows, the amount of work increases at that rate

- APPROACH #2: Track min & max
- we find the min and max through 2 passes
- it's faster and less comparisons are made
- ANSWER: we consider this 2n because as the data grows, the amount of work increases by 2

- APPROACH #3: Sorted List
- if it's sorted, we know smallest is at the beginning and largest is at the end
- ANSWER: number of operations is 2

- **TECHNICAL CLASSIFICATIONS**
- O(n^2) = quadratic time, compares all numbers (n^2)
- O(n) = linear time, find min and max numbers (2n)
- O(1) = constant time, sorted list, find first and last (2)

- *FROM FAST TO SLOW*
- notice we drog any non-significant numbers to simplify to the classifications below
- constant > logarithmic > linear > quadratic > exponential
- O(1)     > O(logn)     > O(n)   > O(n^2)    > O(k^n)

### Native Methods & Javascript (4/13/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/native-methods-javascript/
- TOPICS: Time Complexity, JS Methods, Property Access, Loops, Native Array Methods
- sort is nlogn, we will visit this more
```js
// What are some simple, native JS
// methods/expressions/operations?
const arr = [1,2,3]
arr.forEach() // linear time
arr.pop() //-> [1,2], constant time
arr[0] // 1, constant time
arr.shift() // linear time
arr.unshift() // linear time

const obj = {a: 1}
obj.a //-> 1, constant time
1 + n // constant time
```

---

### Big O Notation (4/13/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/big-o-notation/
- TOPICS: constant, linear, quadratic, logarithmic, and exponential

- *what if we have multiple expressions/loops/etc?*
- if we don't have them in a loop, we add them together
- if there is a loop in a loop, we multiply it but have to also consider what's inside (IE recursion)

- *what about O(logn)?*
- logarithm can have difference bases, it depends on what you're dividing by
- most of the time we'll deal with base 2
- as your input increases, the work, or number of operations need to be done, is increased by a fraction
- we can't always assume that n is the same, not always length of array, etc.

- **COMPLEXITY OF COMMON OPERATIONS**
- O(1) = running a statement
- O(1) = value lookup on an array, object, variable
- O(logn) = loop that cuts problem in half every iteration
- O(n) = looping through the values of an array
- O(n^2) = double nested loop
- O(n^3) = triple nested loop

---

### Space Complexity & Review (4/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/space-complexity-review/
- [GfG Asymptomatic Notation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-of-algorithms-set-3asymptotic-notations/)
- TOPICS: space complexity, big O notation, time complexity

- With space complexity, it follows the same notation
- We should think about how much space is being taken up and how often we are making that space
- with call stack, are you also doing recursion because that also takes space in memory

- Big O Notation gives us an industry-standard language to discuss the performance of algorithms
- Not knowing how to speak about it makes you seem like an inexperienced programmer

- Time complexity of an algorithm signifies the total time required by the program to run to completion
- there are other notations out there used in academic settings
- Big O is worst case scenario, there's also average and best case scenario

---

### Big O: Loop (4/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/big-o-loop/
- [Big O Cheatsheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com/)
- TOPICS: dissection of a loop

- **COUNT CHARS FUNCTION**
- evaluate each line for complexity
- both cases will be `linear time`
```js
var countChars = function(str) {
  var count = 0; // always 1 operation

  for (var i = 0; i < str.length; i ++) {
    count++; // depends on inputs
  }

  return count; // always 1 operation
}

countChars("dance"); // runs through for loop 5 times
countChars("walkreallyfast"); // runs through for loop 14 times
```

---

### Big O: Property Lookup (4/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/big-o-property-lookup/
- TOPICS: time complexity, array length method

- **WHAT IS THE TIME COMPLEXITY?**
- The real question is how does the str get the length?
- does it run through all the characters when we call `length`?
- ANSWER: Nope, JS is smart because it keeps the length as we go along
- ANSWER: It will always be a `constant time` algorithm
- if the method goes through every character, it would be `linear time`
```js
var countChars = function(str){
  return str.length;
}

countChars("dance");
countChars("walkreallyfast");
```

---

### Big O: Push, Shift, & Unshift (4/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/big-o-push-shift-unshift/
- TOPICS: time complexity, array methods

```js
var myList = ["hello", "hola"];
myList.push("bonjour"); // constant time
myList.unshift(); // linear time
myList.shift(); // linear time
```

---

## C) Optimization with Caching

---

### Faster Algorithms (4/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/faster-algorithms/
- TOPICS: speed up algorithms, caching, breadcrumbs

- How can we speed this up?
- this does 9 comparisons between 3 numbers to check it there no match
- ANSWER: This is O(n^2) or quadratic time
```js
const isUnique = (arr) => {
  let result = true;

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(`~~~~ OUTER LOOP ~~~~ i === ${i}`);

    for (let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
      console.log(`~~~~ INNER LOOP ~~~~ j === ${j}`);
      if (i !== j && arr[i] === arr[j]) {
        result = false;
      }
    }
  }

  return result;
};

console.log(isUnique([1,2,3]) === true);
// console.log(isUnique([1,1,3]) === false);
```

- **METHOD 1: BREADCRUMB**
- we store the values in an object to have quicker access
- we keep track of what we've already seen and we cache it in an object
- object property look ups are always constant time
- we can take a `quadratic time` function and make it `linear time`

- ANSWER: linear time operation because only 1 loop
```js
isUnique = (arr) => {
  const breadcrumbs = {};
  let result = true;

  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(`~~~~ LOOP ~~~~ i === ${i}`);
    if (breadcrumbs[arr[i]]) {
      result = false;
    } else {
      breadcrumbs[arr[i]] = true;
    }
  }

  return result;
};

console.log(isUnique([1,2,3]) === true);
// console.log(isUnique([1,1,3]) === false);
```

### Unique Sort Exercise (4/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/unique-sort-exercise/
- TOPICS: removes duplicates
```js
// Task: Transform this simple sorting algorithm into a unique sort.
// It should not return any duplicate values in the sorted array.

//input: [1,5,2,1] => output: [1,2,5]
//input: [4,2,2,3,2,2,2] => output: [2,3,4]

const uniqSort = function(arr) {
    const breadcrumbs = {};
    const newArr = [];

    for (let i of arr) {
      if (breadcrumbs[i]) {
        continue
      }
      else {
        breadcrumbs[i] = true
        newArr.push(i)
      }
    }

    return newArr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
};

uniqSort([4,2,2,3,2,2,2]); // => [2,3,4]
```

---

### Unique Sort Solution (4/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/unique-sort-solution/
- TOPICS: JSON.stringify
- this solution speeds up `quadratic` to `linear` time
- javascript sort method can be generally though of as `nlogn` operation

- **BUG**
- in this solution, there's a bug because we introduced the first element into result but not into breadcrumbs
- subsquently, other 4's will get pushed into results
- we can solve this by 1 of 2 ways:
1) starting i at 0
2) initiating breadcrumbs with element 0 to be true

- **JSON.STRINGIFY()**
- keep in mind pre-ES6, object keys are strings so we should stringify keys before setting them in
- in ES6, objects supports different types

```js
//Task: Transform this simple sorting algorithm into a unique sort, meaning that it should not return any duplicate values in the sorted array.

const uniqSort = function(arr) {
    const breadcrumbs = {};
    const result = [arr[0]];

    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { // start loop at 1 as element 0 can never be a duplicate
        if (!breadcrumbs[arr[i]]) { // constant
            result.push(arr[i]); // constant
            breadcrumbs[arr[i]] = true; // constant
        }
    }
    return result.sort((a, b) => a - b); // nlogn
};

uniqSort([4,2,2,3,2,2,2]); // => [2,3,4]
```

### Caching with Memoization (4/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/caching-with-memoization/
- TOPICS: differences of breadcrumbs vs memoization

- memoization is caching the result of a function
- in the previous example, breadcrumbs did not store results from the function but from the for loop
- memoization is a type of caching
- caching in javascript is generally saving to an object or array
- for javascript engineers, we live in the browser where time complexity is more important than space complexity

- **FACTORIAL**
- we store the `factorial(35)` results since it is an expensive operation
```js
const factorial = (n) => {
    // Calculations: n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... (2) * (1)
    return factorial;
}

factorial(35);
factorial(36); // factorial(36) = factorial(35) * 36;
```

### Basic Memoization Exercize (4/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/basic-memoization-exercise/
- TOPICS: global cache, memoize

-
```js
// Task 1: Write a function, times10, that takes an argument, n, and multiples n times 10
// a simple multiplication fn
const times10 = (n) => {
  return n * 10;
};

console.log('~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TASK 1~~~~~~~~~~~~~~');
console.log('times10 returns:', times10(9));

// Task 2: Use an object to cache the results of your times10 function.
// protip 1: Create a function that checks if the value for n has been calculated before.
// protip 2: If the value for n has not been calculated, calculate and then save the result in the cache object.

const cache = {};

const checkCalc = (n) => {
  if (!cache[n]) {
    const result = times10(n);
    cache[n] = result;
  }
  return cache[n];
}

const memoTimes10 = (n) => {
  return checkCalc(n);
}

console.log('~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TASK 2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~');
console.log('Task 2 calculated value:', memoTimes10(9));	// calculated
console.log('Task 2 cached value:', memoTimes10(9));	// cached
```

---

### Basic Memoization Solution (4/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/basic-memoization-solution/
- TOPICS:
```js
// Task 1: Write a function, times10, that takes an argument, n, and multiples n times 10
// a simple multiplication fn
const times10 = (n) => n * 10;

console.log('~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TASK 1~~~~~~~~~~~~~~');
console.log('times10 returns:', times10(9));

// Task 2: Use an object to cache the results of your times10 function.
// protip 1: Create a function that checks if the value for n has been calculated before.
// protip 2: If the value for n has not been calculated, calculate and then save the result in the cache object.

const cache = {};

const memoTimes10 = (n) => {
  if (n in cache) {
    console.log('Fetching from cache: ', n);
    return cache[n];
  }
  else {
    console.log('Calculating result');
    let result = times10(n);
    cache[n] = result;
    return result;
  }
}

console.log('~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TASK 2~~~~~~~~~~~~~~');
console.log('Task 2 calculated value:', memoTimes10(9));	// calculated
console.log('Task 2 cached value:', memoTimes10(9));	// cached
```

---

### Memoization with Closure Exercise (4/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/memoization-with-closure-exercise/
- TOPICS: cache in closure

- hint: use closure to return a function that you can call later
- hint: we store that closure to a variable, then we use the variable name to call it later
- hint: important that return a function, and not a primitive value, so we can call it later
- hint: in the closure, we retain access to variables that were passed in before and you can "remember" prior values

```js
const times10 = (n) => (n * 10);

// Task 3: Clean up your global scope by moving your cache inside your function.
// protip: Use a closure to return a function that you can call later.

const memoizedClosureTimes10 = () => {
  const cache = {}
};

const memoClosureTimes10 = memoizedClosureTimes10();
console.log('~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TASK 3~~~~~~~~~~~~~~');
try {
  console.log('Task 3 calculated value:', memoClosureTimes10(9));	// calculated
  console.log('Task 3 cached value:', memoClosureTimes10(9));	// cached
} catch(e) {
  console.error('Task 3:', e);
}
```

---

### Memoization with Closure Solution (4/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/memoization-with-closure-solution/
- TOPICS: cache in closure, separate cache concept

- this helps prevent global scope of cache where multiple functions interact with it that creates side effects
- because of closure, now we can reference variables declared in the parent scope IE the cache
- now the cache persists across calls and not wiped

- when we call `memoClosureTimes10(9)`, we are calling the return function of `memoizedClosureTimes10`, not the whole `memoizedClosureTimes10` function
- `n` parameter represents the the argument being passed in from `memoClosureTimes10(9)` IE 9
- if you want to add a 2nd argument or more you have to use `(n,m)` or `(n, ...args)`

```js
const times10 = (n) => (n * 10);

// Task 3: Clean up your global scope by moving your cache inside your function.
// protip: Use a closure to return a function that you can call later.

const memoizedClosureTimes10 = () => {
  const cache = {}
  return (n) => {
    if (n in cache) {
      console.log('Fetching from cache: ', n);
      return cache[n];
    }
    else {
      console.log('Calculating result');
      let result = times10(n);
      cache[n] = result;
      return result;
    }
  }
};

const memoClosureTimes10 = memoizedClosureTimes10();
console.log('~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TASK 3~~~~~~~~~~~~~~');
try {
  console.log('Task 3 calculated value:', memoClosureTimes10(9));	// calculated
  console.log('Task 3 cached value:', memoClosureTimes10(9));	// cached
} catch(e) {
  console.error('Task 3:', e);
}
```

- **SEPARATE CACHE CONCEPT**
- everytime you call a new function, you create a new execution environment complete with it's own cache
- `memoClosureTimes10` and `memoClosureTimes5` will each have it's own cache now
```js
const times10 = (n) => (n * 10);

// Task 3: Clean up your global scope by moving your cache inside your function.
// protip: Use a closure to return a function that you can call later.

const memoizedClosureTimesM = (m) => {
  const cache = {}
  return (n) => {
    if (n in cache) {
      console.log('Fetching from cache: ', n);
      return cache[n];
    }
    else {
      console.log('Calculating result');
      let result = n * m;
      cache[n] = result;
      return result;
    }
  }
};

const memoClosureTimes10 = memoizedClosureTimesM(10);
const memoClosureTimes5 = memoizedClosureTimesM(5);
```

### Generic Memoize Function Exercise (4/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/generic-memoize-function-exercise/
- TOPICS:

- building off previous exercise
- we are going to make the `times10` even more generic
- we want to be able to make it so you can pass the `times10` function, or any other function that we create, into the `memoize` function
- what if we want to pass in an `add5` function or `subtract2` function as a callback?

- general steps to memoizing:
1) Call the `memoize` function with an argument of a function (`memoize` could be stored in a variable)
2) The `memoize` function should have a `cb` parameter, a `cache`, and a `return function`

```js
const times10 = (n) => (n * 10);
// Task 4: Make your memo function generic and accept the times10 function as a callback rather than defining the n * 10 logic inside the if/else or pulling it in from the global scope.

// protip: Take advantage of the fact that parameters are saved in the closure as well, just like the cache from the previous example.
const memoize = (cb) => {
  const cache = {}
  return (n) => {
    if (n in cache) {
      console.log('Fetching from cache: ', n);
      return cache[n];
    }
    else {
      console.log('Calculating result');
      let result = cb(n);
      cache[n] = result;
      return result;
    }
  }
}

// returned function from memoizedAdd
const memoizedTimes10 = memoize(times10);
console.log('~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TASK 4~~~~~~~~~~~~~~');
try {
  console.log('Task 4 calculated value:', memoizedTimes10(9));	// calculated
  console.log('Task 4 cached value:', memoizedTimes10(9));	// cached
} catch(e) {
  console.error('Task 4:', e)
}
```

---

### Generic Memoize Function Solution (4/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/generic-memoize-function-solution/
- TOPICS: memoize

- to make it further generic, you could also use `...args` instead of `n`
- DISTINCTION: `cache` and `cb` will stay the same the second time `memoizedTimes10` is called
- however the `...args` will be a fresh set aka all the variables in that return function is going to be reinitialized IE it will be a new 9
- the time complexity remains unchanged, but this helps us by saving us expensive operations by storing the results in a cache
```js
const times10 = (n) => (n * 10);
// Task 4: Make your memo function generic and accept the times10 function as a callback rather than defining the n * 10 logic inside the if/else or pulling it in from the global scope.

// protip: Take advantage of the fact that parameters are saved in the closure as well, just like the cache from the previous example.
const memoize = (cb) => {
  const cache = {}
  return (...args) => {
    if (n in cache) {
      console.log('Fetching from cache: ', n);
      return cache[n];
    }
    else {
      console.log('Calculating result');
      let result = cb(...args);
      cache[n] = result;
      return result;
    }
  }
}

// returned function from memoizedAdd
const memoizedTimes10 = memoize(times10);
```

### Reviewing Optimization (4/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/reviewing-optimization/
- TOPICS: different caching techniques, trade-offs

- we are increasing space complexity to decrease time complexity
- usually this process is fine if your function calls or operations are expensive
- you might hear this as "using a hash table to optimize", this is what they mean

---

## D) Recursion

---

### Introducing Recursion (4/16/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/introducing-recursion/
- TOPICS:

- Recursion is simply when a function calls itself; however it doesn't stop there
- it's an elegant solution to keep your code D.R.Y.
- sometimes recursion is easier than iterative approach

---

### Call Stack Walkthrough (4/16/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/call-stack-walkthrough/
- TOPICS: call stack game, recursion rules, returns are important

- you have to add a return or else we'll get a `stack overflow`
- also add a `base case`

- **RULES**
1. Push called Fn on stack.
2. Execute Fn body.
- until...
- ... another fn is called:
  - Pause the current execution and start at step 1.
- ... a return is hit:
  - Pop the current Fn off the stack.
  - Resume executing the previous Fn.
```js
// INFINITE LOOP
var callMe = function() {
  callMe();
  callMe();
  callMe('anytime');
}
callMe();

// ALSO INFINITE LOOP
var callMe = function() {
  return callMe();
  callMe();
  callMe('anytime');
}
callMe();
```

- **RETURNS ARE IMPORTANT**
- notice that we get an undefined since 2nd call doesn't pass on "loops!"
- if we want to pass it on, we can add `return` to `return callMe('anytime')`
- we can trace the base case all the way back up

- EDGE CASE: next time if we call the function again, `tracker = 3`
- we can reset this in the base case by setting `tracker = 0`
```js
var tracker = 0;
var callMe = function() { // 1st CALL
  tracker++
  if (tracker === 3) {
      return 'loops!';
  }
  callMe('anytime'); //=> returns undefined
  ~~~~~
};

var callMe = function() { // 2nd CALL
  tracker++
  if (tracker === 3) {
      return 'loops!';
  }
  callMe('anytime'); //=> returns 'loops!'
  ~~~~~
};

var callMe = function() { // 3rd CALL
  tracker++
  if (tracker === 3) {
      return 'loops!';
  }
  callMe('anytime');
};

callMe();
```

### Looping with Recursion (4/16/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/looping-with-recursion/
- TOPICS: how to build recursion, scope of child

- **Recursion in 4 Steps**
1. Identify base case(s).
2. Identify recursive case(s).
3. Return where appropriate.
4. Write procedures for each case that bring you closer to the base case(s).
```js
var callMyself = function() {
  if() {
    // base case
    return;
  } else {
    // recursive case
    callMyself();
  }
  return;
};
```

- child can interact with parent but not vice versa
- notice subsequent calls can still access `n`
```js
const loopNTimes = (n) => {

  console.log('n ===', n);

  if (n <= 1) {
      return 'complete';
  }
  return loopNTimes(n-1);
};

loopNTimes(3);
```

---

### Factorial with a Loop (4/16/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/factorial-with-a-loop/
- TOPICS: iterative vs recursive approach

- what pattern do you notice?
```js
// ITERATIVE APPROACH
function computeFactorial(num) {
  var result = 1;

  for(var i = 2; i <= num; i++) {
    console.log(`result = ${result} * ${i} (${result * i})`);
    result *= i;
  }

  return result;
}
computeFactorial(5);

// CONDENSED ITERATIVE APPROACH
function computeFactorial(num) {
  var result = 1;

  for(var i = 2; i <= num; i++) {
    result *= i;
  }

  return result;
}
computeFactorial(5);

// WITH RECURSION
function computeFactorial(num) {
  if (num === 1) {
    console.log('hitting the base case');
    return 1;
  } else {
    console.log(`returning ${num} * computeFactorial(${num - 1})`);
    return num * computeFactorial(num - 1);
  }
}
computeFactorial(5);

// EXAMPLE A: Iterative Approach
function logNumbers(start, end) {
  console.log(`iteratively looping from ${start} until ${end}`);

  for(var i = start; i <= end; i++) {
    console.log('hitting index', i);
  }
}
console.log('~~~ logNumbers ~~~')
logNumbers(1,2);

// EXAMPLE A: Recursion Approach
function logNumbersRecursively(start, end) {
  console.log(`recursively looping from ${start} until ${end}`);

  function recurse(i) {
    console.log('hitting index', i);
    if(i < end) {
      recurse(i + 1);
    }
  }

### Looping Review (4/16/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/looping-review/
- TOPICS:

- recursion can always be implemented as an iterative loop
- but in some situations believe it or not, it is simpler to use recursion

- `tail-call optimization` - ES6 offers TCO, which allows some functions to be called without growing the call stack
- [Tail call optimization in ECMAScript 6](http://2ality.com/2015/06/tail-call-optimization.html)

### Wrapper Functions (4/16/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/wrapper-functions/
- TOPICS: wrapper, accumulators, closure

- **COMMON PATTERNS FOR RECURSION**
1) Wrapper Functions - has a base case check
2) Accumulators - next lesson
```js
// WRAPPER FUNCTION 1
// Utilizes a closure
// When we access `end` from the inner function, we are accessing a closure scoped variable
function wrapperFnLoop(start, end) {
  function recurse(i) {
    console.log(`looping from ${start} until ${end}`);

    if(i < end) {
      recurse(i + 1);
    }
  }

  recurse(start);
}

// WRAPPER FUNCTION 2
// Does not utilize a closure
function MemoFnLoop(i, end) {
  console.log(`looping from ${i} until ${end}`);
  if(i < end) {
    MemoFnLoop(i + 1, end);
  }
}

console.log('~~~ wrapperFnLoop ~~~')
wrapperFnLoop(1,5);
console.log('~~~ MemoFnLoop ~~~')
MemoFnLoop(1, 6);
```

### Accumulators (4/17/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/accumulators/
- TOPICS: accumulator passing

- this technique employs passing the accumulator along with each recursive call to build this string
```js
function joinElements(array, joinString) {

  function recurse(index, resultSoFar) {
    resultSoFar += array[index];

    if(index === array.length - 1) {
      return resultSoFar;
    } else {
      return recurse(index + 1, resultSoFar + joinString);
    }
  }

  return recurse(0, '');
}

joinElements(['s','cr','t cod', ' :) :)'], 'e');
```

---

### Iterative Loop Exercise (4/17/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/iterative-loop-exercise/
- TOPICS: recursion and iterative translation

- translation between recursion and iterative approach is key for dynamic programming approach
- don't forget to add the smiley faces at end since our loop does not take care of that
```js
// Task: rewrite this function so that it uses a loop rather than recursion
function joinElements(array, joinString) {
  let resultSoFar = ''

  for (let i = 0; i < array.length-1; i++) {
		resultSoFar += (array[i] + joinString)
  }

  return resultSoFar + array[array.length-1];
}

joinElements(['s','cr','t cod', ' :) :)'], 'e');
```

### Iterative Loop Solution (4/17/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/iterative-loop-solution/
- TOPICS:
- I was able to get the same solution and wrote it the same way
- solution in previous lesson

---

### Recursive Factorial & Memoize Exercise (4/17/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/recursive-factorial-memoize-exercise/
- TOPICS:

- recommends we write code so we can avoid the "false understanding" fallacy because we are being explained the process and it seems easy
- we can look at the iterative solution for hints
- try to write out the whole code and reason through it without running the code at every step

- my task 2 wasn't a memoize function but it worked
```js
// =======================================
// Task 1: Without peeking, write your own recursive factorial method
function recurse(num) {
  if (num === 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  return num * recurse(num-1);
}
recurse(5);
// return 5 * recurse(4); // 120
// return 4 * recurse(3); // 24
// return 3 * recurse(2); // 6
// return 2 * recurse(1); // 2

// =======================================
// Task 2: Use your memo function from the previous exercise to memoize your factorial method
function factorial(num) {
  if (num === 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  return num * memoRecurse(num-1)
}

function memoRecurse(num) {
  const cache = {}

  if (num in cache) {
    return cache[num]
  }
  else {
    cache[num] = factorial(num)
    return factorial(num)
  }
}
memoRecurse(5)
```

---

### Recursive Factorial & Memoize Solution (4/17/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/recursive-factorial-memoize-solution/
- TOPICS: generic memoization

```js
// MY SOLUTION
// Closer to Generic Memoize Function Exercise on 4/15/19
// Only difference is I abstracted out the calculate function, like the times10 function
// calling it `cb` makes it easier for me to recognize
const calculate = (x) => {
	if (x === 1) {
		return 1
	}
	else {
		return x * factorial(x-1);
	}
}

const memoize = (cb) => {
	const cache = {}

	return (m) => {
		if (m in cache) {
			return cache[m];
		}
		else {
			const result = cb(m);
			cache[m] = result;
			return result;
		}
	}
}

const factorial = memoize(calculate);

console.log(factorial(5)); // calculated
console.log(factorial(5)); // results already in cache now and quicker to return

// LECTURE SOLUTION
// the function is passed directly instead of spliting out like my solution
const memoize = (fn) => {
  let cache = {};
  return (...args) => {
    let n = args[0];
    if (n in cache) {
      console.log('Fetching from cache', n);
      return cache[n];
    }
    else {
      console.log('Calculating result', n);
      let result = fn(n);
      cache[n] = result;
      return result;
    }
  }
}

const factorial = memoize(
  (x) => {
    if (x === 0) {
      return 1;
    }
    else {
      return x * factorial(x - 1);
    }
  }
);

console.log(factorial(5)); // calculated
console.log(factorial(5)); // cached for 5
```

## E) Divide and Conquer

---

### Introduction to Divide & Conquer (4/18/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/introducing-divide-conquer/
- TOPICS: binary search, sorted array

- a recursive strategy to break down huge problems into smaller ones so we can come up with a solution
- a common example is sorted `binary search` by cutting the side of the search area in half of a sorted array
- we start by dividing in half and then searching one side or the other, but NOT both
- it's progressively search halves to find the value but it MUST be sorted
- it takes `linear time` and decreased it to `logarithmic time`
- `binary search` = logarithmic time, search for a value in a **sorted** array by cutting the side of the search area in half
- `linear search` = linear time, search for a value in an array by checking each value in order
```
Initial: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], search for 7
Step 1: [1, 2, 3, 4, ~~5~] [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], is 7 < 5? No, we drop the first half
Step 2: [6, 7, ~~8~~, 9, 10], is 7 < 8? Yes, we drop the last half
Step 3: [6, ~~7~~, 8] is 7 <= 7? Yes, we found our answer
```

---

### Linear Search Exercise (4/18/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/linear-search-exercise/
- TOPICS: linear search

- can do this many ways: forEach, forIn, forOf, some, includes, filter
- questions to ask:
1) what do you want to return if found and not found?
2) what if there are multiple item's?
3) what if the list is empty?
```js
// TASK: Implement linear search.
function linearSearch(list, item) {
  // method 1
  return list.includes(item) ? item : '';

  // method 2
  // return list.filter(n => item === n)[0];
}

linearSearch([2,6,7,90,103], 90);
```

---

### Linear Search Solution (4/18/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/linear-search-solution/
- TOPICS:

- this is `linear time` in the worst case, item is at the end of the array
```js
// TASK: Implement binary search.
function binarySearch(list, item) {
  let index = -1
  list.forEach((listItem, i) => {
    if (listItem === i) {
      index = i;
    }
  })
  return index;
}

binarySearch([2,6,7,90,103], 90);
```

---

### Binary Search (4/18/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/binary-search/
- TOPICS:

- with `binary search`, common implementation is the start in the middle
- `quicksort` on the other hand, could start at difference places like at the end
- this algorithm cuts the array and searches either left half or right half
```js
function binarySearch(list, item) {
  let min = 0;
  let max = list.length -1;
  let guess;

  while (min <= max) {
    guess = Math.floor((min+max) / 2)

    if (list[guess] == item) {
      return guess;
    }
    else {
      if (list[guess] < item) {
        min = guess + 1;
      }
      else {
        max = guess - 1;
      }
    }
  }

  return -1;
}

binarySearch([2,6,7,90,103], 90);
```

---

### Divide & Conquer Review (4/18/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/divide-conquer-review/
- TOPICS:

- it's a recursive calls to a subset of a problem
- steps are:
```
0. Recognize base case
1. Divide: Break problem down during each call
2. Conquer: Do work on each subset
3. Combine: Solutions
```

- the combine steps can look different between sort types
- it would be clear in a `merge sort` but is kind of skipped in `binary search`

---

### Sorting Types (4/18/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/sorting-types/
- TOPICS:

- there are `searches` and `sorts`, we are covering sorts in this lesson
- there are also noncomparison sorts but we are not covering it in this course

- there are often data structures that combines well with `searches`
- like `binary tree` with `binary search`

- **2 CLASSES OF COMPARISON SORTS**
- [David Galles Sort Animations](http://rebootjeff.github.io/comparisonsort/)

1) **Naive Sorts** - keep looping and comparing values until the list is sorted, quadratic time
a) *bubble sort* - Loop through an array, comparing adjacent indices and swapping the greater value to the end
b) *insertion sort*
c) *selection sort*

2) **Divide & Conquer Sorts** - recursively divide lists and sort smaller parts of list until entire list is sorted, nlogn time
a) *merge sort* - Recursively merge sorted sub-lists.
b) *quick sort*

---

### Merge Sort (4/20/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/merge-sort/
- TOPICS:
- [David Galles Sorting Comparisons](http://rebootjeff.github.io/comparisonsort/)
- [Merge-sort Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaqR3G_NVoo)

- the merge step is the conquer part
- it compares the 2 final arrays and compares values starting from the left and then `shift` it out to `insert` into a new array

- **PSEUDOCODE**
```js
// [3,27] //[9,10] => [3,9,10,27]
// PSEUDOCODE
mergeSort(list)
  // 1. base case: if list.length < 2, return (Divide input array into 'n' single element subarrays)
  // 2. break the list into halves L & R
  // 3. Lsorted = mergeSort(L)
  // 4. Rsorted = mergeSort(R)
  // 5. return merge(Lsorted, Rsorted) (Repeatedly merge subarrays and sort on each merge)

merge(L,R)
// 1. initialize empty array
// 2. compare the first index of the left array
// to the first index of the right array
// 3. push the lower value to empty array
// 4. shift the array with the lower value
// 5. repeat until both arrays are empty
```

---

### Merge Sort Walkthrough (4/20/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/merge-sort-walkthrough/
- TOPICS:

- went over another case of merge sort
- Recursion `O(logn)` to divide the list, and the linear portion `O(n)` to merge the list together again, final time complexity is `O(n * logn)`

- **MORE PSEUDOCODE**
```js
mergeSort(list)
  initialize n to the length of the list

  base case is if n < 2, just return

  initialize mid to n/2

  left = left slice of array to mid - 1

  right = right slice of array mid to n - 1

  mergeSort(left)
  mergeSort(right)

  merge(left, right)
```

`[9, 2, 5, 6, 4, 3, 7, 10, 1, 8];`
`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];`
`[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1];`

- **BASIC BUBBLE SORT**
- without comments
```js
function bubbleSort(arr) {
	for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
		for (let j = 0; j <arr.length; j++) {
			if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {
				[arr[j], arr[j+1]] = [arr[j+1], arr[j]];
			}
		}
	}
	return arr;
}

console.log(bubbleSort([9, 2, 5, 6, 4, 3, 7, 10, 1, 8]))
console.log(bubbleSort([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]))

	let swapped;
  do {
    swapped = false;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {

        [arr[i], arr[i+1]] = [arr[i+1], arr[i]]
        swapped = true;
      }
    }
  } while(swapped);

  return arr;
}

console.log(bubbleSort([9, 2, 5, 6, 4, 3, 7, 10, 1, 8]))

console.log(bubbleSort([10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]))
```

- **MERGE SORT**
- TASK: implement mergesort!
- protip: Split the array into halves and merge them recursively
- protip: return once we hit an array with a single item. That is a sorted array of size 1!
- protip: compare the arrays item by item and return the concatenated result
- without comments
```js
function mergeSort (arr) {
  if (arr.length === 1) {
    return arr
  }

  const mid = Math.floor(arr.length / 2)
  const left = arr.slice(0, mid)
  const right = arr.slice(mid)
  const sortedLeft = mergeSort(left);
  const sortedRight = mergeSort(right);
  return merge(sortedLeft, sortedRight);
}

function merge(left, right) {
  let result = []
  let indexLeft = 0
  let indexRight = 0

  while (indexLeft < left.length && indexRight < right.length) {
    if (left[indexLeft] < right[indexRight]) {
      result.push(left[indexLeft])
      indexLeft++
    } else {
      result.push(right[indexRight])
      indexRight++
    }
  }

  return result.concat(left.slice(indexLeft)).concat(right.slice(indexRight))
}

const list = [2, 5, 1, 3, 7, 2, 3, 8, 6, 3]
console.log(mergeSort(list)) // [ 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 ]
```

### Bubble Sort Solution (4//19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/bubble-sort-solution/
- TOPICS:

- Bubble sort is a `quadratic` time complexity
- If you're dealing with a mostly sorted list, than it's an okay sort
- if the list is reversed, it's terrible

- TIPS: the variables `countInner`, `countOuter`, and `countSwap` are only there to be instructive to how many times the algorithm hit it, so if they are confusing you, you can delete them

- BIG O: Bubble sort is a `quadratic` time complexity
- **BASIC SORT**
- we have to run `arr[j-1] > arr[j]` in order to pull the value from the previous j-loop interation up
- I didn't use this in my code since it's confusing
- if we don't do that, the highest number would never bubble to the far right
```js
//TASK: Implement bubblesort!
// sample of arrays to sort
var arrayRandom = [9, 2, 5, 6, 4, 3, 7, 10, 1, 8];
var arrayOrdered = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
var arrayReversed = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1];

function swap(array, i, j) {
  var temp = array[i];
  array[i] = array[j];
  array[j] = temp;
}

// BASIC
// arrayRandom => outer: 10, inner: 90, swap: 21
// arrayOrdered => outer: 10, inner: 90, swap: 0
// arrayReversed => outer:10, inner: 90, swap: 45
function bubbleSortBasic(array) {
  var countOuter = 0;
  var countInner = 0;
  var countSwap = 0;
  for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    countOuter++;
    for(var j = 1; j < array.length; j++) {
      countInner++;
      if(array[j - 1] > array[j]) {
        countSwap++;
        swap(array, j - 1, j);
      }
    }
  }

  console.log('outer:', countOuter, 'inner:', countInner, 'swap:', countSwap);
  return array;
}
console.log('~~~ ~~~ BASIC ~~~ ~~~');

console.log('\n~~~ basic: arrayRandom ~~~');
bubbleSortBasic(arrayRandom.slice());

console.log('\n~~~ basic: arrayOrdered ~~~');
bubbleSortBasic(arrayOrdered.slice());

console.log('\n~~~ basic: arrayReversed ~~~')
bubbleSortBasic(arrayReversed.slice());
```

- **OPTIMIZED BUBBLE SORT**
- solution gets rid of any extra looping if array is already sorted
- notice the less amount of loopings compared to basic bubble sort
```js
// OPTIMIZED
// arrayRandom => outer: 9, inner: 90, swap: 21
// arrayOrdered => outer: 1, inner: 10, swap: 0
// arrayReversed => outer:10, inner: 100, swap: 45
function bubbleSort(array) {
  var countOuter = 0;
  var countInner = 0;
  var countSwap = 0;

  var swapped;
  do {
    countOuter++;
    swapped = false;
    for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
      countInner++;
      if(array[i] && array[i + 1] && array[i] > array[i + 1]) {
        countSwap++;
        swap(array, i, i + 1);
        swapped = true;
      }
    }
  } while(swapped);

  console.log('outer:', countOuter, 'inner:', countInner, 'swap:', countSwap);
  return array;
}

console.log('\n\n~~~ ~~~ OPTIMIZED ~~~ ~~~');

console.log('\n~~~ optimized: arrayRandom ~~~');
bubbleSort(arrayRandom.slice());

console.log('\n~~~ optimized: arrayOrdered ~~~');
bubbleSort(arrayOrdered.slice());

console.log('\n~~~ optimized: arrayReversed ~~~');
bubbleSort(arrayReversed.slice());
```

### Merge Sort Solution (4//19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/merge-sort-solution/
- TOPICS:

- **INTERVIEW STRATEGY**
1) generally ask you how would you sort an unsorted array of numbers
2) implement bubble sort since it's quicker and maybe reference mergesort if you're really good at it
3) tell them you're aware that bubble sort is quadratic time and mergesort is nlogn time but for the time constraints, bubble sort is faster to implement without all the mistakes that can make your code not work in mergesort
- merge sort is a lot of code and many points in the algorithm that can go wrong
- javascript engine uses quicksort, or mergesort, depending on the situation

```js
//TASK: implement mergesort!

// Split the array into halves and merge them recursively
function mergeSort (arr) {
  if (arr.length === 1) {
    // return once we hit an array with a single item
    return arr
  }

  const middle = Math.floor(arr.length / 2) // get the middle item of the array rounded down
  const left = arr.slice(0, middle) // items on the left side
  const right = arr.slice(middle) // items on the right side
  const sortedLeft = mergeSort(left);
  const sortedRight = mergeSort(right);
  return merge(sortedLeft, sortedRight);
}

// compare the arrays item by item and return the concatenated result
function merge (left, right) {
  let result = []
  let indexLeft = 0
  let indexRight = 0

  while (indexLeft < left.length && indexRight < right.length) {
    if (left[indexLeft] < right[indexRight]) {
      result.push(left[indexLeft])
      indexLeft++
    } else {
      result.push(right[indexRight])
      indexRight++
    }
  }

  return result.concat(left.slice(indexLeft)).concat(right.slice(indexRight))
}

const list = [2, 5, 1, 3, 7, 2, 3, 8, 6, 3]
console.log(mergeSort(list)) // [ 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 ]
```

## F) Greedy Algorithms

---

### Introducing Greedy (4/22/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/introducing-greedy/
- TOPICS:

- it takes the short solution at that time without looking at the big picture
- `Greedy Algorithm` always makes the locally optimal choice
- we are talking about the general approach, not in a mathematical sense

- greedy algorithm helps you get a solution, albeit not the most practical
- there was a weight-gragh as an example
- a graph was shown about how to get from A to B

---

### Greedy Algorithms Walkthrough (4//19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/greedy-algorithms-walkthrough/
- TOPICS:

- **PROBLEM**
```
You are the banker in Monopoly with your family who has lost many of the game pieces so you only have bills in these denominations:

$5 $10 $25

You need only pay out your family in the least number of bills possible so you don't run out before the game is over. Write a function that calculates the least number of bills required for any given dollar amount that is divisible by 5.
```

- **MY CODE SOLUTION**
- Was not specified there was an array type of coins
```js
// Write a function, makeChange, that returns an integer that represents the least number of coins that add up to an amount where the amount is always divisible by 5.
// coin values: 5, 10, 25
// input amount: 40 , output # of coins: 3 (25, 10, 5)
// input amount: 35, output # of coins: 2 (25, 10)
function makeChange(n) {
	let count = 0;

	if (n % 25 >= 0) {
		let divided = Math.floor(n/25);
		n -= (divided*25);
		count += divided;
	}
	if (n % 10 >= 0) {
		let divided = Math.floor(n/10);
		n -= (divided*10);
		count += divided;
	}
	if (n % 5 == 0 || n / 5 > 1) {
		let divided = Math.floor(n/5);
		n -= (divided*5);
		count += divided;
	}

	return count;
}

console.log(makeChange(40)); // 3
console.log(makeChange(35)); // 2
```

- **OFFICIAL GREEDY SOLUTION**
```js
const makeChange = (coins, amount) => {
  coins.sort((a, b) => b - a);
  let coinTotal = 0;
  let i = 0;
  while (amount > 0) {
    if (coins[i] <= amount) {
      amount -= coins[i];
      coinTotal++;
    } else {
      i++;
    }
  }
  return coinTotal;
};

makeChange([5, 10, 25], 50);
```

---

### Brute Force (4//19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/brute-force/
- TOPICS:

- `Greedy Approach` - always subtract the largest coin possible from the current amount.
- isn't always the best approach because we can say for sure the short solution is the overall best

- Would these values work with your greedy solution?
- coin values: 1,6,10
- input: 12
- the `greedy` method will break down here because it doesn't test all the paths as a big picture
- `greedy` is also hard to prove that it is correct since it is so short-sighted

- `Brute Force Approach` - calculate every single combination possible and keep track of the minimum.
- we would go through every possibility and use recursion

- **OFFICIAL BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION**
- this would be `exponential` time so `greedy` solution would be faster in some cases
- even with a moderate data set, this would take up a lot of time
```js
// Write a function, makeChange, that returns an integer that represents the least number of coins that add up to the amount, n.
let recursionCounter = 0;
const coins = [10, 6, 1];

const makeChange = (value, i) => {
  recursionCounter++;
  console.log(`${recursionCounter}: calling ${value} at ${i}`)
  if (value === 0) return 0;
  let minCoins;
  coins.forEach((coin, i) => {
    if (value - coin >= 0) {
      let currMinCoins = makeChange(value - coin, i);
      if(minCoins === undefined || currMinCoins < minCoins) {
        minCoins = currMinCoins;
      }
    }
  });
  return minCoins + 1;
};

makeChange(12);
```

## G) Dynamic Algorithms

---

### Introducing Dynamic Programming (4/23/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/introducing-dynamic-programming/
- TOPICS:

- `dynamic programming` is an optimization technique
- the challenge with dynamic programming is more with the recursion than the memoization
- it's being able to trace through how the code executes to solve these problems
- improve your mental model and practice recursion

- *qualities*: optimal substructure (recursive usually), overlapping subproblems

- *DP vs Divide & Conquer*:
- DP recursion results are something you can cache
- DC recursion are something you have to go through every time

- *approaches*: Top Down and Bottom Up
- cache values to avoid repeated calculations
- there are many ways to cache your solution
- `top-down (recursive) technique`is one method
- `bottom-up (iterative) technique` is another
---

### Memoization with Recursion (4/23/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/practical-algorithms/memoization-with-recursion/
- TOPICS:

- our makeChange brute-force function only needs a cache for dynamic programming
- there is a better way than to keep the global cache and memoize but not the aim of this lesson
- also better if you pass in `coins` array as arguments rather than a global variable

```js
const cache = {};
const coins = [10, 6, 1];

const makeChange = (c) => {
  // Return the value if it’s in the cache
  if (cache[c]) return cache[c];

  let minCoins = -1;

  // Find the best coin
  coins.forEach(coin => {
    if (c - coin >= 0) {
      let currMinCoins = makeChange(c - coin);
      if (minCoins === -1 || currMinCoins < minCoins) {
        minCoins = currMinCoins
      }
    }
  })

  // Save the value into the cache
  cache[c] = minCoins + 1;
  return cache[c];
}

console.log(makeChange(12));
```

# Testing React Applications v4 /w Kent C. Dodds

## A) Introduction

---

### Course Overview (4/25/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/course-overview/

- **COURSE COVERAGE**
- Learn the fundamentals of what a test is and what role testing frameworks play
- configure Jest for a client-side React project
- Learn what Code Coverage is and how to properly use that metric
- Write unit tests for JavaScript utilities and React components
- Learn what snapshot testing is and how to use it effectively
- Write integration tests for a React application
- Configure Cypress for a web application
- Write E2E (end-to-end) tests with Cypress

- **NOT COVERED**
- no mocha, no jasmine
- not using enzyme
- not covering all form of testings

- **SETUP**
- [Course github repo](https://github.com/kentcdodds/testing-workshop/tree/fem-2018)
- [Slides](https://slides.com/kentcdodds/testing-react-apps#/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
---

### Testing Fundamentals (4/25/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/testing-fundamentals/
- [But really, what is a JavaScript test](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/but-really-what-is-a-javascript-test/)

- **STATIC CODE ANALYSIS**
- `ESLint` can be really helpful
- `Flow` is a static type checker
- `Prettier` is to format and make code more readable
- don't enforce ESLint styles rules other than syntax corrections, we have Prettier for that

- these run in the background and you don't have to configure them
- we are not using these tools today
- Kent recommends Flow or TypeScript

- **UNIT TESTING**
- can use `ReactDOM`, DOM elements, and make assertions in Jest
- usually straightforward and smaller

- **INTEGRATION TESTING**
- bigger experience and you have to render out the entire application
- you get more coverage than an unit test
- can be a little bit slower and harder to integrate like network requests

- **END-TO-END TESTS**
- treating app as black box and take in user inputs and

- **WHAT IS A JAVASCRIPT TEST?**
- essentially when an error is thrown when something is wrong

---

### Writing a React Test & Exercise (4/26/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/writing-a-react-test-exercise/

- started with `other` > `simple-react`
- use testing -> `item-list.todo.js` to start
- run updates with `npm run setup --silent`
- use `npm run test:react` to have testing CLI running
- this is a warmup
- follow arrange, act, assert steps

---

### Writing a React Test Solution (4/26/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/writing-a-react-test-solution/
- [JEST expect documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect)

- **1ST TEST**
- instead of testing for `expect(container.innerHTML).toBe('no items')`
- this test might change whether you have a `div` or a `span` wrapping around that texts

- a more appropriate test would be `expect(container.textContent).toMatch('no items')`
- this test checks for the text but doesn't concern with the DOM structure
- it just verifies the user experience remains the same
- `toMatch()` is a regex match, not an exact text match

- there are multiple tools to test for `visual regression testing`
- it has been easier now with newer tools but testing UI is inherently difficult
- like Cypress (screenshotting) or Jest (Puppeteer)

- **2ND TEST**
- not a high fidelity test because item order can change, ul & li might change
- this will at least test that those items will render
- if you're more concern with specific HTML tags like `ol` or `ul`, you can use `snapshot testing`
- testing higher fidelity and snapshot testing to come

---

## B) Test Configurations

---

### Configuring Jest & Babel (4/26/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/configuring-jest-babel/

- working with other > configuration > calculator directory
- `npm run dev`
- `npm install --save-dev jest`
- added to scripts `"test": "jest"`

- jest has a lot of features and takes some time to install

- in real world, your babel should compile everything except imports because webpack supports ES modules (tree shaking)

- spoke about `tree shaking` and babelrc file which I don't understand quite yet
- Kent also converts his babelrc file to a JS file from JSON and declares it in package.json

- **babelrc.js file**
```js
const isTest = String(process.env.NODE_ENV) === 'test'

module.exports = {
  presets: [['env', {modules: isTest ? 'commonjs' : false}], 'react'],
  plugins: [
    'syntax-dynamic-import',
    'transform-class-properties',
    'transform-object-rest-spread',
  ],
}
```

---

### Jest JSDOM (4/26/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/jest-jsdom/

- `JSDOM` runs by default but if we don't need to access things like the window
- it's heavy memory wise so adds to the start time
- if you are doing pure node or javascript, you can remove it

- there are various test environments but node and jsdom are pre-installed with Jest
```js
  "jest": {
    "testEnvironment": "node" // can be shortened
    // "testEnvironment": "jests-environment-node"
  },
```


---

### CSS Imports (4/26/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/css-imports/

- worked with auto-scaling file
- node can't import CSS so it will either do JSON or javascript module
- added another `jest.config.js`, Jest will pick it up by default
- Usually run in the client since it's more complex than the server
- you can also run 2 separate test environments in parallel and should all work

- installed `npm install --save-dev indetity-obj-proxy`
- this module mapper concept is useful when you're also using graphQL or loaders
- we are using CSS modules here

---

### CSS Modules (4/27/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/css-modules/

- in a real world application, you'll have `dynamic imports`
- Node doesn't support ES modules or dynamic imports
- we can use `npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node` to convert dynamic import to the node equivalent

- hard to simulate local storage in node but now we have proxies

---

### Handling Dynamic Imports (4/27/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/handling-dynamic-imports/

- `local storage` is similar to `session storage` so you will also support it due to similar api
- as long as you're using the `removeItem`, `setItem`, `getItem` methods then it will work okay for mocks
- we can also use `setupTestFrameworkScriptFile` when we need to run something before out tests run
---

### Adding Code Coverage Reports (4/27/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/adding-code-coverage-reports/

- `code coverage` usually required installing multiple dev dependencies
- now we can just add `"test": "jest --coverage" in our package.json

- we are also recording our test coverage files and can bring our overall results higher than it should be
- usually Kent has 2% lower than the original
- sometimes the highlight request is not always perfect
- we can fix this by adjusting our jest configuration using `collectCoverageFrom:`
- we can set the coverage by adding:
```js
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    statements: 18,
    branches: 10,
    functions: 19,
    lines: 18
  }
}
```
---

### Jest Watch Mode (4/27/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/jest-watch-mode/

- add this watch mode by adding `"test:watch": "jest --watch"`
- Jest by default runs tests only on changed file since the last commit so helps saves time

- you can also filter out specific tests based on file name, test name, failed test, and other names

---

### Jest Config Review (4/27/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/jest-config-review/

- Jest creates a test coverage folder called `lcov-report`, make sure to add to .gitignore

- Engineers should be responsible for testing their code but usually it's the QA role that helps set it up

- Jest also can run a client and server folder in a single repo with the command in parallel using `./node_modules/.bin/jest`
- you can set different coverage threshold for each

- **TO DO LIST TO CONFIG JEST**
1) Add Jest as dependency
2) Add `babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node` as dev dependency
3) Added `"test": "jest --coverage"` an `"test:watch": "jest --watch"` scripts
4) Add a couple tests
5) Add `jest.config.js`
```js
module.exports = {
  displayName: 'calculator',
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  setupTestFrameworkScriptFile: require.resolve(
    './test/setup-test-framework.js',
  ),
  moduleNameMapper: {
    // module must come first
    '\\.module\\.css$': 'identity-obj-proxy',
    '\\.css$': require.resolve('./test/style-mock.js'),
    // can also map files that are loaded by webpack with the file-loader
  },
  // normally you'd put this here
  // collectCoverageFrom: ['**/src/**/*.js'],
}
```

6) Update `.babelrc.js` for tree shaking
```js
const isTest = String(process.env.NODE_ENV) === 'test'
module.exports = {
  presets: [['env', {modules: isTest ? 'commonjs' : false}], 'react'],
  plugins: [
    'syntax-dynamic-import',
    'transform-class-properties',
    'transform-object-rest-spread',
    isTest ? 'dynamic-import-node' : null,
  ].filter(Boolean),
}
```

---

## C) Unit Testing React Components

---

### Course Project Overview (4/27/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/course-project-overview/

- working on root directory and ran `npm run dev`
- we are testing this form component
- login is `til`/`til`

---

### Unit Testing a React Component (4/27/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/unit-testing-a-react-component/
- [But Really, What is a Javascript Mock?](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/but-really-what-is-a-javascript-mock/)

- we are working in `client>scr>screens/__tests__/editor.todo.js`
- run `npm run test:client` to run tests
- the only react item is the `ReactDOM.render(<Editor />, container)`, otherwise you can run with Vuejs

- **NAIVE METHOD**
- naive method is long way to do it, used refined method in practice
- we rendered the container with content
- then we fired a submit event
- we use `jest.mock` to mock APIs
- we also create fake users and history during mocks

- `flushPromises` helps to deal with async nature
- we use utilsMock to mock the data being sent in the API request
```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import * as utilsMock from '../../utils/api'
import Editor from '../editor.todo'

jest.mock('../../utils/api', () => {
  return {
    posts: {
      create: jest.fn(() => Promise.resolve()),
    }
  }
})

const flushPromises = () => {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(resolve, 0)
  })
}

test('calls onSubmit with the username and password when submitted', async () => {
  const container = document.createElement('div')
  const fakeUser = { id: 'foobar' }
  const fakeHistory = {
    push: jest.fn(),
  }
  ReactDOM.render(<Editor user={fakeUser} history={fakeHistory} />, container)
  const form = container.querySelector('form')
  const { title, content, tags } = form.elements

  title.value = 'I like twix'
  content.value = 'Like a lot..sorta'
  tags.value = 'twix,      my      , likes'

  const submit = new window.Event('submit')
  form.dispatchEvent(submit)

  await flushPromises()

  expect(fakeHistory.push).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(fakeHistory.push).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/')
  expect(utilsMock.posts.create).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(utilsMock.posts.create).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
    authorId: fakeUser.id,
    title: title.value,
    content: content.value,
    tags: ['twix', 'my', 'likes'],
    date: expect.any(String),
  })
  // Arrange
  // create a fake user, post, history, and api
  //
  // use ReactDOM.render() to render the editor to a div
  //
  // fill out form elements with your fake post
  //
  // Act
  // submit form
  //
  // wait for promise to settle
  //
  // Assert
  // ensure the create function was called with the right data
})

// TODO later...
test('snapshot', () => { })
```

- **JS MOCK EXERCISE**
- in `testingWorkshop/other/whats-a-mock/__tests__/thumb-war-1.todo.js`
```js
// // FIRST ITERATION
// monkey-patching
import thumbWar from '../thumb-war'
// import the utils module (see hint #1 at the bottom of the file)
import * as utils from '../utils'

test('returns winner', () => {
  // keep track of the original `getWinner` utility function (see hint #2)
  const originalGetWinner = utils.getWinner

  // overwrite the utils.getWinner function with
  // our own that always returns the second player (see hint #3)
  utils.getWinner = (p1, p2) => p2

  const winner = thumbWar('Ken Wheeler', 'Kent C. Dodds')
  // change this assertion to be more for a specific player
  // (like 'Kent C. Dodds', see hint #4):
  expect(winner).toBe('Kent C. Dodds')

  // restore the originalGetWinner function so other tests don't break
  // (see hint #5)
  utils.getWinner = originalGetWinner
})



// // SECOND ITERATION
import thumbWar from '../thumb-war'

  expect(utils.getWinner.mock.calls).toHaveLength(2)
  utils.getWinner.mock.calls.forEach(args => {
    expect(args).toEqual(['Ken Wheeler', 'Kent C. Dodds'])
  })

  utils.getWinner = originalGetWinner
})



// // THIRD ITERATION
import thumbWar from '../thumb-war'

  expect(winner).toBe('Kent C. Dodds')
  expect(utils.getWinner).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2)
  utils.getWinner.mock.calls.forEach(args => {
    expect(args).toEqual(['Ken Wheeler', 'Kent C. Dodds'])
  })

  utils.getWinner = originalGetWinner
})



// // FOURTH ITERATION
import thumbWar from '../thumb-war'

    expect(args).toEqual(['Ken Wheeler', 'Kent C. Dodds'])
  })
})



// FIFTH ITERATION
import thumbWar from '../thumb-war'

### Test a Form Component Exercise (4/28/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/test-a-form-component-exercise/
- [How Jest mocking works](https://github.com/kentcdodds/how-jest-mocking-works)
- In `client/src/components/__tests__/login.step-1.todo.js`

- **MY ATTEMPT**
- lecture solution is more clean

```js
// Basic unit test
import React from 'React'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import Login from '../login'

test('calls onSubmit with the username and password when submitted', () => {
  // Arrange
  // 🐨 create a fake object to hold the form field values (username and password)
  const fakeUser = {
    username: 'johndoe',
    password: 'fake',
  }
  // 🐨 create a jest.fn() for your submit handler
  const handleSubmit = jest.fn()

  // 🐨 render the Login component to a div
  // 💰 const div = document.createElement('div')
  const div = document.createElement('div')
  ReactDOM.render(<Login onSubmit={handleSubmit} />, div)

  // 🐨 get the field nodes
  // 💰 const inputs = div.querySelectorAll('input')
  // 💰 const form = div.querySelector('form')
  const formNode = div.querySelector('form')
  const inputs = div.querySelectorAll('input')
  const usernameNode = inputs[0]
  const passwordNode = inputs[1]

  const event = new window.Event('submit')
  formNode.dispatchEvent(event)

  // Assert
  // 🐨 ensure your submit handler was called properly
  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledWith(fakeUser)
  expect(submitButtonNode.type).toBe('submit')
})
```

---

### Test a Form Component Solution (4/28/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/test-a-form-component-solution/

- question about using refs in react testing situation
- we will have a better method soon but usings refs can get to be a pain really quickly
```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import Login from '../login'

test('calls onSubmit with the username and password when submitted', () => {
  const handleSubmit = jest.fn()
  const container = document.createElement('div')
  ReactDOM.render(<Login onSubmit={handleSubmit} />, container)

  const form = container.querySelector('form')
  const { username, password } = form.elements
  username.value = "chucknorris"
  password.value = "nopassword"

  form.dispatchElement(new window.Event('submit'))

  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(handleSubmit).tohaveBeenCalledWith({
    username: username.value,
    password: password.value,
  })
}
```

---

### Enzyme Limitations (4/28/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/enzyme-limitations/

- `react-testing-library` came about from FEM workshop
- `dom-testing-library` came from react-testing-library and it was just general dom stuff


- **ENZYME CONS**
- your tests should resemble the way that your software is used
- Enzyme is testing tool for react with mount, render, shallow render
- problems with enzyme:
1) Enzyme provides utilities to test things that are not being used in reality like shallow rendering
- shallow rendering doesn't render all the components and you have to make separate unit tests to tests other smaller forms, inputs, etc.
- it will not render custom components
- shallow rendering bottom line: makes you code to an implementation and not behavior, which is bad
2) Users don't care what you name your component and the amount of components
- The name of the function is not component because the user doesn't care what the name of it is
- if you go to change the name, your tests breaks
- doesn't matter if you have 1 or 5 length in a div

---

### react-testing-library (4/29/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/react-testing-library/
- [react-testing-library repo](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)
- [babel-plugin-react-remove-properties](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-react-remove-properties)

- `dom-testing-library` is just javascript testing, not react/angular/vue specific
- we use the `getByText()` because that's how our users would find a button as well

- **getByLabelText**
- similar to how a user would search for a field to enter information
- uses `for=` in javascript and `htmlFor=` in react
- we can use `for`, `aria-labelledby`, or `aria-label` (not recommended)
- you can still use snapshot with this type of testing

- `getByPlaceholderText` not recommended either for accessibility reasons

- **getByTestId**
- `getByTestId` is useful for testing specific components and does no harm to your application (pairs with `data-testid=` element attribute)
- using data-testid helps communicate that this is a testable element, unlike using classes where tests can break if someone changes from `btn-disabled` to `btn-success`
- `await wait(() => getByTestId('greeting-text'))` waits for the promise to come back without error, this returns a dom node

- `babel-plugin-react-remove-properties` is a package that can help remove this data-testid attribute if you're really uncomfortable with it
- although you are shipping this to production code, it won't be a bottleneck, other places to optimize file size, and users won't know the difference if you use this extra attribute

- `cleanup` method will remove all things that were inserted into the document

---

### react-testing-library Exercise (4/29/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/react-testing-library-exercise/
- [ReactJS simulate](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-utils.html#simulate)

- **ADDITIONAL TEST METHODS**
- `simulate` is a re-export from react dom (DEPRECATED)
- you would use this when you need to do a left click on a react-dom-router link

- `wait` accepts a callback

- `waitForElement` will give you back element you are waiting for

- **STEP 2 TESTING**
- now on `client/src/components/__tests__/login.step-2.todo.js`
- my attempt:

```js
// using helpful utilities
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
// 🐨 you'll need these:
import { generate } from 'til-client-test-utils'
import { render, fireEvent } from 'react-testing-library'

// note that til-client-test-utils is found in `client/test/til-client-test-utils`
// note also that the client/test/setup-test-framework.js file takes care of
// `import react-testing-library/cleanup-after-each'` for us.
import Login from '../login'

test('calls onSubmit with the username and password when submitted', () => {
  // Arrange
  // 🐨 use generate.loginForm() here instead of assigning fakeUser to an object
  // const fakeUser = { username: 'chucknorris', password: '(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻' }
  generate.loginForm()
  const handleSubmit = jest.fn()
  // 🐨 use: render(<Login onSubmit={handleSubmit} />)
  // It'll give you back an object with
  // `getByLabelText` and `getByText` functions
  // so you don't need a div anymore!
  // 💰 const {getByLabelText, getByText} = render(<Login onSubmit={handleSubmit} />)
  const { getByLabelText, getByText } = render(<Login onSubmit={handleSubmit} />)

  const usernameNode = getByLabelText('Username')
  const passwordNode = getByLabelText('Password')
  const submitButtonNode = getByText('Submit')
  // const div = document.createElement('div')
  // ReactDOM.render(<Login onSubmit={handleSubmit} />, div)
  // const inputs = div.querySelectorAll('input')
  // const usernameNode = inputs[0]
  // const passwordNode = inputs[1]
  // const formNode = div.querySelector('form')
  // const submitButtonNode = div.querySelector('button')

  usernameNode.value = 'chucknorris'
  passwordNode.value = '╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻'

  // Act
  // 🐨 Use fireEvent.click(submitButtonNode) instead of these two lines
  // const event = new window.Event('submit')
  // formNode.dispatchEvent(event)
  fireEvent.click(submitButtonNode)

  // Assert
  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledWith({ usernameNode, passwordNode})
  // 🐨 this assertion is no longer necessary:
  // expect(submitButtonNode.type).toBe('submit')
})
```

### react-testing-library Solution (4/29/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/react-testing-library-solution/

- `generate` function actually generates a username and password for you
- having an actual username like "chucknorris" and password can be distracting
- `getByLabelText` doesn't care if it's lowercase or not either, so "Username" === "username"
- or you can use a regex

- **LABEL & INPUT LINKAGE**
- the label element `htmlFor` attribute is linked with the input element `name` attribute
- the label element `id` attribute is linked with the input element `arialabelledby` attribute

- if there are multiple labels with the same name, it won't create an array
- POSSIBLE APPROACH: just create container and target label in that

- **VALID SOLUTION 1**
```js
import React from 'react'
import {generate} from 'til-client-test-utils'
import {render, fireEvent} from 'react-testing-library'
import Login from '../login'

test('calls onSubmit with the username and password when submitted', () => {
  // Arrange
  const fakeUser = generate.loginForm()
  const handleSubmit = jest.fn()
  const {getByLabelText, getByText} = render(<Login onSubmit={handleSubmit} />)

  const usernameNode = getByLabelText(/username/i)
  const passwordNode = getByLabelText(/password/i)
  const submitButtonNode = getByText(/submit/i)

  // Act
  usernameNode.value = fakeUser.username
  passwordNode.value = fakeUser.password
  fireEvent.click(submitButtonNode)

  // Assert
  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledWith(fakeUser)
})
```

- **VALID SOLUTION 2**
- we must be aware that the `submitButtonNode` must have a type of "submit" on it or this test will not work
- `Simulate` is deprecated
```
BREAKING CHANGE: `renderIntoDocument` replaces `render` and `Simulate` is no longer exported (use `fireEvent` instead).

https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library/commit/52575005579307bcfbe7fbe4ef4636147c03c6fb
```

```js
import React from 'react'
import { generate } from 'til-client-test-utils'
import { render, fireEvent } from 'react-testing-library'
import Login from '../login'

test('calls onSubmit with the username and password when submitted', () => {
  // Arrange
  const fakeUser = generate.loginForm()
  const handleSubmit = jest.fn()
  const { container, getByLabelText, getByText } = render(<Login onSubmit={handleSubmit} />)

  const usernameNode = getByLabelText('Username')
  const passwordNode = getByLabelText('Password')

  const formNode = container.querySelector('form')
  const submitButtonNode = getByText('Submit')

  usernameNode.value = fakeUser.username
  passwordNode.value = fakeUser.password

  // Act
  // Simulate.submit(formNode) // no longer works, use fireEvent instead
  fireEvent.click(submitButtonNode)

  // Assert
  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledWith(fakeUser)
  expect(submitButtonNode.type).toBe('submit')
})
```

### Using DOM Events Exercise (4/29/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/using-dom-events-exercise/

- **STEP 3 TESTING**
- now on `client/src/components/__tests__/login.step-3.todo.js`
- my attempt:
```js
// snapshot testing
import React from 'react'
import {generate} from 'til-client-test-utils'
import {render, cleanup} from 'react-testing-library'
import Login from '../login'

afterEach(cleanup)

test('calls onSubmit with the username and password when submitted', () => {
  // Arrange
  const fakeUser = generate.loginForm()
  const handleSubmit = jest.fn()
  const {getByLabelText, getByText} = render(<Login onSubmit={handleSubmit} />)

  const usernameNode = getByLabelText(/username/i)
  const passwordNode = getByLabelText(/password/i)

  // Act
  usernameNode.value = fakeUser.username
  passwordNode.value = fakeUser.password
  getByText(/submit/i).click()

  // Assert
  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledWith(fakeUser)
})

test('snapshot', () => {
  // render the login, this will give you back an object with a `container` property
  const {container} = render(<Login />)
  // expect the `container` property to match a snapshot
  expect(container).toMatchSnapshot()
})
```

---

### Using DOM Events Solution (4/29/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/using-dom-events-solution/

- `renderIntoDocument` is deprecated, `render` is default

```
BREAKING CHANGE: `renderIntoDocument` replaces `render` and `Simulate` is no longer exported (use `fireEvent` instead).

https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library/commit/52575005579307bcfbe7fbe4ef4636147c03c6fb
```

- `unmount` also doesn't work, use `afterEach(cleanup)` instead

- **SOLUTION**
- `getByText(/submit/i).click()` works the same as `fireEvent.click(submitButtonNode`

```js
// snapshot testing
import React from 'react'
import {generate} from 'til-client-test-utils'
import {render, cleanup} from 'react-testing-library'
import Login from '../login'

afterEach(cleanup)

test('calls onSubmit with the username and password when submitted', () => {
  // Arrange
  const fakeUser = generate.loginForm()
  const handleSubmit = jest.fn()
  const {getByLabelText, getByText} = render(<Login onSubmit={handleSubmit} />)

  const usernameNode = getByLabelText(/username/i)
  const passwordNode = getByLabelText(/password/i)

  // Act
  usernameNode.value = fakeUser.username
  passwordNode.value = fakeUser.password
  getByText(/submit/i).click()

  // Assert
  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalledWith(fakeUser)
})

test('snapshot', () => {
  // render the login, this will give you back an object with a `container` property
  const {container} = render(<Login />)
  // expect the `container` property to match a snapshot
  expect(container).toMatchSnapshot()
})
```

### Component Testing Q&A (4/29/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/component-testing-q-a/

- **QUESTION ON USING UI EFFECTS AND SETTIMEOUT**
- `jest.useFakeTimer` and `jest.runAllTimers()` in case you need to wait for a blur effect or something
- `wait` or `waitForElement` also works for APIs

- **QUESTION ABOUT TESTING STATE**
- not necessarily needed because it could potentially break
- if we have a spinner loader after a button is clicked, then just test that it shows up
- we dont need to check if the boolean in the state is switched on of off

- BOTTOM LINE: we want to make overarching tests that don't break on refactors, then user smaller tests on edge cases

---

## D) Snapshot Testing

---

### Introducing Snapshot Testing (4/30/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/introducing-snapshot-testing/
- [import-all.macro](https://github.com/kentcdodds/import-all.macro)

- in `other/jest-epect/__tests__/expect-assertions.js`
- use `npm run test:expect`

- you can run a `manual snapshot` or `automatic snapshot`
- Kent would `console.log(flyingHeros)` and then copy paste in `.toEqual()`
- instead of use `.toEqual()`, you can use `toMatchSnapshot()`
```js

test('manual "snapshot"', () => {
  const flyingHeros = getFlyingSuperHeros()
  expect(flyingHeros).toEqual([
    {name: 'Dynaguy', powers: ['disintegration ray', 'fly']},
    {name: 'Apogee', powers: ['gravity control', 'fly']},
  ])
})

test('automatic snapshot', () => {
  const flyingHeros = getFlyingSuperHeros()
  expect(flyingHeros).toMatchSnapshot()
})
```

- snapshots will be in the in `__snapshots__` folder and can be updated with "u" key
- we'll commit snapshots to source control, any changes will be recognized, updated, and commited

- **SERIALIZED SNAPSHOTS**
- the snapshot file will serialize all the html elements
- it will also do other elements like DOM nodes and react elements
```js
test('snapshot examples', () => {
  const object = {
    mixedArray: [1, [2, 3], {four: 5, six: [7, 8]}],
    regex: /do-not-try-to-regex-an-email/,
    date: new Date('1988-10-18'),
    error: new Error('some error'),
    someFunction: () => {},
    symbol: Symbol('symbol description'),
    set: new Set([1, 2, 3]),
    map: new Map([[{}, []], [[], {}]]),
    // and more!
  }
  expect(object).toMatchSnapshot()

  // AND DOM NODES!!!
  const div = document.createElement('div')
  const title = '<h2 class="title">Super Heros are great!</h2>'
  const content =
    '<p class="content">We can each be a super hero for someone</p>'
  div.innerHTML = `<section>${title}${content}</section>`
  expect(div).toMatchSnapshot('title of a snapshot!')

  // And react elements!
  const onClick = () => {}
  const element = React.createElement('button', {onClick}, 'Hello World')
  expect(element).toMatchSnapshot('react element')

  // and rendered elements
  const rendered = renderer.create(element)
  expect(rendered).toMatchSnapshot('rendered')

  // and DOM nodes rendered via react
  const app = document.createElement('div')
  ReactDOM.render(element, app)
  expect(app).toMatchSnapshot('react-dom')
})
```

- snapshots are also a good way to test babble plugins
- `import-all.macro` repo on kentcdodds github helps with "A babel-macro that allows you to import all files that match a glob"

---

### Snapshot Testing Exercise (4/30/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/snapshot-testing-exercise/

- you can also do customized manners that snapshots are serialized like taking out `h2` or `paths`
- if you want to do a certain snapshot serialize, you just pass the name of it IE `jest-glamour-react`
- there's one for styled components as well

---

### Snapshot Testing Solution (4/30/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/snapshot-testing-solution/

- looks like we did this exercise in previous video already
- Kent wrote a little differently
```js
test('snapshot', () => {
  // render the login, this will give you back an object with a `container` property
  const {container} = render(<Login />)
  // expect the `container` property to match a snapshot
  expect(container.firstChild).toMatchSnapshot()
})
```

---

### Snapshot Q&A (4/30/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/snapshot-q-a/
- [Effective Snapshot Testing](https://blog.kentcdodds.com/effective-snapshot-testing-e0d1a2c28eca)

- `toMatchSnapshot()` will generate the initial snapshot if there are none
- it might not be worth it to snapshot something that's pure HTML
- if you want to undo a snapshot, you have to do a git reset
- snapshot is not useful for TDD

- Kent's stance on snapshot testing is that it should supplement solid, complete unit tests
- If a small change in snapshot testing, then it shouldn't matter too much IE font-size change
- Kent also uses `.toThrowErrorMatchingSnapshot()` to expect it to throw a certain error matching a regex

---

## E) Integration Testing Pages

---

### Integration Tests Demo (4/30/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/integration-tests-demo/

- tests from unit tests are very similar to integration tests
- Kent will do solution for register form and we will do login form

- we're in `client/src/__tests__/app.register.js`
- we run `axiosMock.__mock.reset()` to clear the state
- we will be doing async function since most will be asynchronous operations
- we are using `renderWithRouter(<App />)` to configure with any components that has a redux or router provider

```js
import React from 'react'
import axiosMock from 'axios'
import {renderWithRouter, fireEvent, generate} from 'til-client-test-utils'
import {init as initAPI} from '../utils/api'
import App from '../app'

beforeEach(() => {
  window.localStorage.removeItem('token')
  axiosMock.__mock.reset()
  initAPI()
})

test('register a new user', async () => {
  const {
    container,
    getByTestId,
    getByText,
    finishLoading,
    getByLabelText,
  } = renderWithRouter(<App />)
```

---

### Integration Tests Exercise (4/30/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/integration-tests-exercise/

- Kent recommends we have a testing file that has testing utility modules like `til-client-test-utils`
- `renderWithRouter` is just like `render` method and exposes `getByText`, `getByLabelText`, etc.
- see more comments below

- **REGISTER FORM WALKTHROUGH**
```js
import React from 'react'
import axiosMock from 'axios'
import {renderWithRouter, fireEvent, generate} from 'til-client-test-utils'
import {init as initAPI} from '../utils/api'
import App from '../app'

beforeEach(() => {
  window.localStorage.removeItem('token') // clears any tokens
  axiosMock.__mock.reset() // resets any api calls
  initAPI()
})

test('register a new user', async () => {
  const {
    container,
    getByTestId,
    getByText,
    finishLoading,
    getByLabelText,
  } = renderWithRouter(<App />) // method exposes just like render

  // wait for the app to finish loading the mocked requests
  await finishLoading()

  // navigate to register
  const leftClick = {button: 0}
  fireEvent.click(getByText(/register/i), leftClick)
  expect(window.location.href).toContain('register') // check if we are on the right url path

  // fill out form
  const fakeUser = generate.loginForm()
  const usernameNode = getByLabelText('Username')
  const passwordNode = getByLabelText('Password')
  const formWrapper = container.querySelector('form')
  usernameNode.value = fakeUser.username
  passwordNode.value = fakeUser.password

  // submit form (we are mocking out post implementation)
  const {post} = axiosMock.__mock.instance
  const token = generate.token(fakeUser)
  post.mockImplementationOnce(() =>
    Promise.resolve({
      data: {user: {...fakeUser, token}},
    }),
  )
  fireEvent.submit(formWrapper)

  // wait for the mocked requests to finish
  await finishLoading()

  // assert calls
  expect(axiosMock.__mock.instance.post).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(axiosMock.__mock.instance.post).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    '/auth/register', // correct endpoint
    fakeUser, // correct user
  )

  // assert the state of the world
  expect(window.localStorage.getItem('token')).toBe(token)
  expect(window.location.href).not.toContain('register')
  expect(getByTestId('username-display').textContent).toEqual(fakeUser.username)
  expect(getByText(/logout/i)).toBeTruthy()
})
```

- **MY ATTEMPT FOR LOGIN FORM**
- run `npm run test:client`
```js
import React from 'react'
import axiosMock from 'axios'
import {renderWithRouter, fireEvent, generate} from 'til-client-test-utils'
import {init as initAPI} from '../utils/api'
import App from '../app/'

// add a beforeEach for cleaning up state and intitializing the API
beforeEach(() => {
  window.localStorage.removeItem('token')
  axiosMock.__mock.reset()
  initAPI()
})

test('login as an existing user', async () => {
  // 🐨 render the app with the router provider and custom history
  // 💰 const utils = renderWithRouter(<App />)
  const {
    container,
    getByText,
    getByLabelText,
    finishLoading,
    getByTestId,
  } = renderWithRouter(<App />)

  // 🐨 wait for the app to finish loading the mocked requests
  // 💰 await utils.finishLoading()
  await finishLoading()

  // 🐨 navigate to login by clicking login-link
  // 💰 the link has text that matches /login/i
  // 💰 when you fireEvent.click on the login link, react-router will ignore
  // the click unless it's a "left click" which is based on the `button`
  // property. So as a second argument to `fireEvent.click`, pass `{button: 0}`
  fireEvent.click(getByText(/login/i), {button: 0})

  // 🐨 assert that window.location.href contains 'login'
  expect(window.location.href).toContain('login')

  // 🐨 fill out the form
  // 💰 generate.loginForm()
  // 💰 get the username and password fields and set their values
  const fakeUser = generate.loginForm()
  const usernameNode = getByLabelText(/username/i)
  const passwordNode = getByLabelText(/password/i)
  const formNode = container.querySelector('form')

  usernameNode.value = fakeUser.username
  passwordNode.value = fakeUser.password

  // Now we need to prepare our axios mock to handle the form submission properly:
  // use the axiosMock.__mock.instance
  // to mock out the post implementation
  // it should return the fake user + a token
  // which you can generate with generate.token(fakeUser)
  // 💰 you may want to look at the final version for this one...
  const {post} = axiosMock.__mock.instance
  const token = generate.token(fakeUser)

  // 🐨 submit form by clicking on the submit button
  post.mockImplementationOnce(() =>
    Promise.resolve({
      data: {user: {...fakeUser, token}},
    }),
  )
  fireEvent.submit(formNode)

  // 🐨 wait for the mocked requests to finish
  // 💰 await utils.finishLoading()
  await finishLoading()

  // 🐨 now make some assertions:
  // assert post was called correctly
  expect(post).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  // assert localStorage is correct
  expect(window.localStorage.getItem('token')).toBe(token)
  // assert the user was redirected (window.location.href)
  expect(window.location.href).not.toContain('login')
  // assert the username display is the fake user's username
  expect(getByTestId('username-display').textContent).toContain(
    fakeUser.username,
  )
  // assert the logout button exists
  expect(getByText(/logout/i)).toBeTruthy()
})
```

---

### Integration Tests Solution (4/30/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/integration-tests-solution/

- **LECTURE SOLUTION**
- if we wanted to test a specific URL path we can use:
`expect(window.location.href).toBe('<url>')`
```js
import React from 'react'
import axiosMock from 'axios'
import {renderWithRouter, generate, fireEvent} from 'til-client-test-utils'
import {init as initAPI} from '../utils/api'
import App from '../app'

beforeEach(() => {
  window.localStorage.removeItem('token')
  axiosMock.__mock.reset()
  initAPI()
})

test('login as an existing user', async () => {
  const {
    getByTestId,
    getByText,
    getByLabelText,
    finishLoading,
  } = renderWithRouter(<App />)

  // wait for the app to finish loading the mocked requests
  await finishLoading()

  // navigate to login
  const leftClick = {button: 0}
  fireEvent.click(getByText(/login/i), leftClick)
  expect(window.location.href).toContain('login')

  // fill out form
  const fakeUser = generate.loginForm()
  const usernameNode = getByLabelText(/username/i)
  const passwordNode = getByLabelText(/password/i)
  usernameNode.value = fakeUser.username
  passwordNode.value = fakeUser.password

  // submit form
  const {post} = axiosMock.__mock.instance
  const token = generate.token(fakeUser)
  post.mockImplementationOnce(() =>
    Promise.resolve({
      data: {user: {...fakeUser, token}},
    }),
  )
  fireEvent.click(getByText(/submit/i))

  // wait for the mocked requests to finish
  await finishLoading()

  // assert calls
  expect(axiosMock.__mock.instance.post).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(axiosMock.__mock.instance.post).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
    '/auth/login',
    fakeUser,
  )

  // assert the state of the world
  expect(window.localStorage.getItem('token')).toBe(token)
  expect(window.location.href).not.toContain('login')
  expect(getByTestId('username-display').textContent).toEqual(fakeUser.username)
  expect(getByText(/logout/i)).toBeTruthy()
})
```

### Integration Testing Q&A (4/30/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/integration-testing-q-a/

- the prevailing theme has been to test the component as a black box and test the public facing API and not the implementation details
- someone mentioned `jest/no-large-snapshot` which is a ESLint rule to limit the amount of lines of a snapshot

---

## F) Configuring Cypress

---

### Cypress (5/1/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/cypress/

- `npm install --save-dev cypress`
- cypress installs and app and sticks in node_modules
- Cypress exposes a binary which we can run with `npx cypress open`

- working in `other/calculator/cypress/`
- `fixtures` are where we keep default user info in DB
- `integration` are where all the tests are, Kent renames to E2E
- `plugins` has purposes but not covered in course
- `support` has commands that we will use later

- **support/index.js**
- need to install `npm install --save-dev cypress-testing-library`
- we add the configs in `support/index.js` file
```js
import 'cypress-testing-library/add-commands'
```

- **cypress.json**
```js
{
  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:8080/",
  "integrationFolder": "cypress/e2e"
}
```

- we used `npm install --save-dev npm-run-all` is a script that lets you run multiple scripts in parallel
- you have to do `npm run build` first
- we add some scripts to package.json,
1) `"test:e2e:dev": "npm-run-all --parallel dev cy:open"`
2) `"cy:open": "cypress open"`
3) `"test:e2e": "npm-run-all --parallel --race start cy:run"`
4) `cy:run: "cypress run"`

---

### Cypress Q&A (5/1/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/cypress-q-a/

- Cypress doesnt work well in other browser execpt Chrome but the benefits outweigh the cons
- Cypress is a lot faster overall than Selenium
- It's best to have a couple selenium tests and cover the rest with Cypress
- the development process is faster overall wth Cypress

---

### Configuring Cypress Exercise (5/1/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/configuring-cypress-exercise/

- We are going to focus on commands `test:e2e` in package.json
- run `npm run test:e2e` to start running tests

- in `./cypress/support/commands.js`
- there's a command that lets you login as a fresh user every time
- it's for registration and login purposes called `loginAsNewUser`
- you can also expose redux store as a global variable and cypress can pick up at a certain state

- in `cypress/e2e/auth.register.js`
- cypress can be used for integration and unit tests as well
- Cypress commands can looks sequential because it carries out synchronous operations and just how it is written

- **MY ATTEMPT**
- in `cypress/integration/auth.login.todo.js`

```js
// Normally you shouldn't need to break your tests up this much.
// Normally I'd just have a file called `auth` and have all my tests
// in that file. But I've split them up like this to make the workshop
// flow nicer with the demo and exercises.
// eslint-disable-next-line
import {generate} from '../utils'

describe('authentication', () => {
  beforeEach(() => cy.logout())

  it('should allow existing users to login', () => {
    // you'll want to first create a new user.
    // This custom cypress command is similar to a promise, so you can do:
    // cy.createNewUser().then(user => {
    //   more cy commands here
    // })

    // With the user created, go ahead and use the cy commands to:
    // 1. visit the app: visitApp
    // 2. Click the login link
    // 3. type the user's username in the username field
    // 4. type the user's password in the password field
    // 5. submit the form by clicking the submit button

    // Finally assert the route changed to '/'
    // and verify that the display name contains user.username
    cy.createNewUser().then(user => {
      const newUser = generate.loginForm()

      cy.getByText(/login/i)
        .click()
        .getByLabelText(/username/i)
        .type(newUser.username)
        .getByLabelText(/password/i)
        .type(newUser.password)
        .getByText(/submit/i)
        .click()
        .assertRoute('/')

      cy.getTestById('username-display').should('contain', newUser.username)
    })
  })
})
```

---

### Configuring Cypress Solution (5/1/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/configuring-cypress-solution/

- **SOLUTION**
- `getByLabelText` and `getByText` is also case insensitive
- or you can use regex

- without Cypress, you can still use DOM selection by using `.get('.some-class-name', <action)`

- Cypress is completely open source and the pricing is for the dashboard

```js
// Normally you shouldn't need to break your tests up this much.
// Normally I'd just have a file called `auth` and have all my tests
// in that file. But I've split them up like this to make the workshop
// flow nicer with the demo and exercises.
// eslint-disable-next-line
import {generate} from '../utils'

describe('authentication', () => {
  let user

  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.logout()
      .createNewUser()
      .then(u => (user = u))
      .visit('/')
  })

  it('should allow existing users to login', () => {
    cy.getByText(/login/i)
      .click()
      .getByLabelText(/username/i)
      .type(user.username)
      .getByLabelText(/password/i)
      .type(user.password)
      .getByText(/submit/i)
      .click()
      .assertRoute('/')

    cy.getTestById('username-display').should('contain', user.username)
  })
})
```

## G) Wrapping Up

---

### Testing Trophy (5/1/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/testing-react/testing-trophy/

- **HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD USE E2E, INTEGRATION, UNIT, STATIC**
- there's a `Testing Trophy` image
- Top to bottom: end to end, integration, unit, static
- static is like typescript, eslint, or flow type

- generally, tests at the top are more expensive and slower to run and vice versa heading to the bottom
- why not just run all unit tests? because you get more confidence and catch bigger problems when using tests at the top of the trophy
- you should spend most of the time doing integration testing, it gives you a lot of bang for your buck

- **BOUNDARY FOR JEST VS CYPRESS**
- when we have a server request and an actual live server to test from, we want to use to Cypress
- if the test doesn't need the server, we can just do integration tests with Jest

### Welcome & Tech Check (5/2/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sql-fundamentals/welcome-tech-check/
- lines between frontend and backend continue to blur

- progressive web apps are becoming "thick clients" and becoming more like a mobile web app

- mechanical sympathy is valuable for improving performance
- learning what's easy and hard for the database and to adjust resources

- SQL fundamentals is a primer for developers who "use" databases
- similarities across all DBs

- Professional SQL is a deeper course for developers who wish to "design and maintain" a database
- tackles topics treated differently depending on RDBMS
- covering MySQL and PostgreSQL

### Relational Algebra & Codds Relational Model (5/2/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sql-fundamentals/relational-algebra-codds-relational-model/

- a database is an organized collection of persisted data
- very diverse kind of family:
1) Relational Stores: SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Google Spanner
2) Key-Value Stores: Redis (IE Amazon Dynamo DB), Voldemort (LinkedIn Open Source)
3) Column Stores: Cassandra, Apache Hbase
4) Graph Databases: Neo4j
5) Document Databases: mongoDB

- we are covering the PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MySQL and what we learn in this course can be used with these

- **Codd's Relational Model**
- a relation (table) is a set of tuples (rows)
- each element in a tuple (cell value) dj is a member of Dj, a data domain (set of allowed values)
- these elements are called attribute values (cell value), and are associated with an attribute (column name + type)

- **SCHEMA**
- greek for shape
- it's the shape or structure of your data
- tables, column names, types and constraints

- **RELATIONAL ALGEBRA VS RELATIONAL CALCULUS**
- algebra: join movie and actor over `actorId`, filter results to only include Jeff Goldblum
- select the `movieTitle` and `year` columns

- calculus: get `movieTitle` and `year` for movie such that there exists an actor a who was in the movie and has the name Jeff Goldblum.

- **STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE**
- we use Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
- declarative, unlike predecessors
- can also be procedural (PL/SQL)
- inspired by Codd's Relational Model

- a statement is made up of:
- clauses: SELECT, WHERE
- predicate: something returns true or false
- expression: something that produces values

- you can run command line SQL
- `psql northwind -c` to run a command (northwind is the name of db)
- `createdb northwind` for creating in PostgresQL
- `dropdb northwind` for dropping in PostgresQL

---
## B) Retrieving Data
---
### Using the Command Line & Simple SELECT queries (5/2/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sql-fundamentals/using-the-command-line-simple-select-queries/

- `SELECT * FROM Employee`
- FROM allos one or more elements to be returned from a relation

- `SELECT id, firstname, lastname FROM Employee`
- returns the order they are asked for

- **QUOTES**
- different in different SQL
- table names, column names, and keywords are case insensitive usually
- 'single quotes' are used for string literals
- "double quotes" (SQLite or PostgreSQL) or `backticks` (MySQL only) for words that conflict with SQL keywords, or when case sensitivity is desired

- TIP: use either `id` or `Id`

- **AS keyword**
- helps alias a column, only impacts current query
- `p.productname AS title`
- `Product AS p`

---
### Project Overview (5/2/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sql-fundamentals/project-overview/

- we are working on a project to keep a supply for a restaurant company
- customers, employees, customer orders, products, suppliers

- the SQL tagged template literal can be used to syntax highlight
"let query = sql`SELECT * FROM Employee`"

- **SCRIPTS**
- setup a database: `npm run db:setup:pg`
- run tests that match a filter: `npm run test EX01`, `npm run test:watch EX01`
- run an exercise's tests, and all tests from previous exercises: `npm run tests:ex 4`, `npm run test:ex:watch 4`

- run on localhost 3000: `npm run watch`
- run tests with a database other than SQLite `DB_TYPE=pg npm run watch`

---
### SELECTing Columns Exercise (5/3/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sql-fundamentals/selecting-columns-exercise/

- in `./src/data/customers.js`
- we are basically running a query that selects all customers
- start the server first with `npm start`
- then `npm run test:ex:watch 1` to see all the tests
- the goal is to get all the tests to pass

- **MYATTEMPT**
```js
// customers
const ALL_CUSTOMERS_COLUMNS = ['id, contactname, companyname'];

// employees
const ALL_EMPLOYEES_COLUMNS = [
  'id',
  'firstname',
  'lastname',
  'region',
  'hiredate',
  'title',
  'reportsto'
];

// orders
export const ALL_ORDERS_COLUMNS = [
  'id',
  'customerid',
  'employeeid',
  'shipcity',
  'shipcountry',
  'shippeddate'
];

// suppliers
const ALL_SUPPLIERS_COLUMNS = ['id, contactname, companyname'];
```

---
### SELECTing Columns Solution (5/3/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sql-fundamentals/selecting-columns-solution/

- the solutions are the same


- there's a VSCode extension: `SQLTools`
- lets you connect to different databases IE PG, MySQL
- lets you see simple data in vscode tab

- he showed how to see tables with the extension in VSCode
- then also in pgAdmin4
- if you want to a custom query, you can do `Schemas > Public > Click Query Tool`

- *Recommended to use more dedicated tools like PgAdmin4 for advance queries*
- *Otherwise just use the SQLtools*

---
### Filtering via WHERE clauses (5/4/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sql-fundamentals/filtering-via-where-clauses/

- **WHERE CLAUSE**
- used to filter result set with a condition
`SELECT firstname, lastname FROM Employee WHERE lastname = 'Leverling'`
- the condition aka predicate is `lastname = 'Leverling'
- be careful not to use Double quote because that would mean special characters or column

- **Other conditions**
- `>, <, >=, <=, =`
- Not equal: `<>` or `!=`
- `BETWEEN` is within a range
- `IN` is member of a set
- `LIKE` matches a string
- string ends with `email LIKE '%.gov'`
- string includes `summary LIKE '%spicy%'`
- string length `billing_state LIKe '__'`

- *Postgres includes ILIKE which is case insensitive LIKE*

- **AND, OR, NOT**
- `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
- boolean operators we can use in predicate
`SELECT productname FROM product WHERE (unitprice > 60 AND unitsinstock > 20)`

- **CORE FUNCTIONS**
- each DB has own set of core functions but all slightly different
- some are synonymous (lower, max, min, count, substr, etc...)
- we can use them in a comparison or as an additional column
- `AS` helps create an alias
`SELECT productname FROM Product WHERE lower(productname) LIKE '%dried%'`
`SELECT lower(productname) AS label FROM Product`

- **DEBUGGING CONDITIONS**
- conditions can be evaluated directly with a SELECT statement
- so it doesn't only have to be used with tables but also with testing statements
`SELECT 'mike@example.com' LIKE '%@example.com'; -- TRUE`
`SELECT 'mike@gmail.com' LIKE '%@example.com'; --FALSE`

---
### Filtering via WHERE Exercise (5/4/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sql-fundamentals/filtering-via-where-exercise/

- in `./src/data/products.js`
- `npm run test:ex:watch 2`

- **TASKS**
- we need add filters for
1) discontinued products
2) to reorder when (Product.unitsinstock + Product.unitsonorder) < Product.reorderlevel
- I did not know how to do this

---
### Filtering via WHERE Solution
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sql-fundamentals/filtering-via-where-solution/

- **PRODUCTS SOLUTION**
- in `./src/data/products`
- we added a whereClause variable to hold a string to add on our query call
```js
/*
 getAllProducts();
 getAllProducts({ filter: { inventory: 'discontinued' } });
 getAllProducts({ filter: { inventory: 'needs-reorder' } });
 */
export async function getAllProducts(opts = {}) {
  const db = await getDb();
  let whereClause = '';
  if (opts.filter && opts.filter.inventory) {
    switch (opts.filter.inventory) {
      case 'discontinued':
        whereClause = 'WHERE discontinued = 1';
        break;
      case 'needs-reorder':
        whereClause = 'WHERE discontinued = 0 AND ((unitsinstock + unitsonorder) < reorderlevel)';
        break;
    }
  }
  return await db.all(sql`
SELECT ${ALL_PRODUCT_COLUMNS.join(',')}
FROM Product ${whereClause}`);
}
```

- **CUSTOMER SOLUTION**
- in `./src/data/customers`
- where need to use lower to lowercase both the string and the column name to standardize with database
- we use `%` in order to match where strings include
- else, we would be searching for strings with those exact letters
```js
/*
  getAllCustomers();
  getALLCustomers({ filter: 'Mike' })
*/
export async function getAllCustomers(options = {}) {
  const db = await getDb();
  let whereClause = '';
  if (options.filter) {
    whereClause = `WHERE lower(companyname) LIKE lower('%${options.filter}%')
    OR lower(contactname) LIKE lower('%${options.filter}%')`;
  }

  return await db.all(sql`
SELECT ${ALL_CUSTOMERS_COLUMNS.join(',')}
FROM Customer ${whereClause}`);
}
```

---
### LIMITing and ORDERing the result set (5/5/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sql-fundamentals/limiting-and-ordering-the-result-set/

- **ORDER BY CLAUSE**
- `ORDER BY` clauase declares desired sorting of the result set
- `ASC`, `DESC` specifies sort direction
- `SELECT productname, unitprice FROM Product ORDER BY unitprice DESC`

- multiple sorts and directions can be done with separated commas
- `SELECT productname, unitprice FROM WHERE unitprice BETWEEN 9.6 AND 11 ORDER BY unitprice ASC, productname DESC`

- **LIMIT CLAUSE**
- when dealing with large data, we can limit amount of results
- the limiting process can be performant if we don't sort results
- limiting & sorting does reduce performance because DB still needs to run through all results and limit the results you specified
`SELECT productname, unitprice FROM Product ORDER BY unitprice DESC LIMIT 3`

- **OFFSET CLAUSE**
- we can start with Nth result
- we can paginate by using LIMIT and OFFSET
- think of limit as the window of data you are looking at
- think of offset as the shift of that window to specific data set

---
### LIMIT AND ORDER EXERCISE (5/5/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sql-fundamentals/limit-and-order-exercise/

- we need to:
- click on column header to sort orders
- take `opts.sort` and `opts.order` into account
- fix `getCustomerOrders`

- in `./src/data/orders.js`
- `npm run test:ex:watch 3`

- **MY ATTEMPT**
```js
/*
getAllOrders({ sort: 'shippeddate', order: 'desc'});
getAllOrders({ sort: 'customerid', order: 'asc' });
*/
export async function getAllOrders(opts = {}) {
  // Combine the options passed into the function with the defaults

  /** @type {OrderCollectionOptions} */
  let options = {
    ...DEFAULT_ORDER_COLLECTION_OPTIONS,
    ...opts
  };
  let sortClause = '';
  let orderClause = '';
  let limitClause = '';
  let offsetClause = '';
  if (opts && opts.sort) {
    sortClause = `ORDER BY ${opts.sort}`;
  }
  if (opts && opts.order) {
    orderClause = `${opts.order}`;
  }
  if (opts && opts.perPage) {
    limitClause = `LIMIT ${opts.perPage}`;
  }
  if (opts && opts.perPage && opts.page) {
    offsetClause = `OFFSET ${opts.perPage * opts.page}`;
  }

  const db = await getDb();
  return await db.all(sql`
SELECT ${ALL_ORDERS_COLUMNS.join(',')}
FROM CustomerOrder ${sortClause} ${orderClause} ${limitClause} ${offsetClause}`);
}

/**
 * Retrieve a list of CustomerOrder records associated with a particular Customer
 * @param {string} customerId Customer id
 * @param {Partial<OrderCollectionOptions>} opts Options for customizing the query
 */
/*
getAllOrders({ page: 3, perPage: 25 });
getCustomerOrders('ALFKI', { page: 5, perPage: 10 });
*/
export async function getCustomerOrders(customerId, opts = {}) {
  // ! This is going to retrieve ALL ORDERS, not just the ones that belong to a particular customer. We'll need to fix this
  if (customerId) {
    opts.sort = `WHERE customerid=${customerId}`;
  }
  return getAllOrders(opts);
}
```

---
### LIMIT And ORDER Solution (5/5/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sql-fundamentals/limit-and-order-solution/

- **LECTURE SOLUTION**
- think of adding variables: `whereClause`, `sortClause`, and `paginationClause`
- *the clause ordering of the query is important*
- think that `orderby` and then `limit/offset` is the right order to tack them on

- notice that we also have default sorts for different functions
- `getAllOrders` by id, asc
- `getCustomerOrders` by shippeddate, asc

- I had to also add `/** @type {OrderCollectionOptions} */` to the `getCustomerOrders` function because it's a typescript thing

```js
const DEFAULT_ORDER_COLLECTION_OPTIONS = Object.freeze(
  /** @type {OrderCollectionOptions}*/ ({
    order: 'asc',
    page: 1,
    perPage: 20,
    sort: 'id'
  })
);

/**
 * Retrieve a collection of "all orders" from the database.
 * NOTE: This table has tens of thousands of records, so we'll probably have to apply
 *    some strategy for viewing only a part of the collection at any given time
 * @param {Partial<OrderCollectionOptions>} opts Options for customizing the query
 * @returns {Promise<Order[]>} the orders
 */
/*
getAllOrders();
getAllOrders({ sort: 'shippeddate', order: 'desc'});
getAllOrders({ sort: 'customerid', order: 'asc' });
getAllOrders({ page: 3, perPage: 25 });
getCustomerOrders('ALFKI', { page: 5, perPage: 10 });
*/
export async function getAllOrders(opts = {}, whereClause = '') {
  // Combine the options passed into the function with the defaults

  /** @type {OrderCollectionOptions} */
  let options = {
    ...DEFAULT_ORDER_COLLECTION_OPTIONS,
    ...opts
  };

  const db = await getDb();
  let sortClause = '';
  let paginationClause = '';

  if (options.sort && options.order) {
    sortClause = `ORDER BY ${options.sort} ${options.order.toUpperCase()}`;
  }
  if (typeof options.page !== 'undefined' && options.perPage) {
    paginationClause = `LIMIT ${options.perPage} OFFSET ${(options.page - 1) * options.perPage}`;
  }

  return await db.all(sql`
SELECT ${ALL_ORDERS_COLUMNS.join(',')}
FROM CustomerOrder ${whereClause}
${sortClause}
${paginationClause}`);
}

/**
 * Retrieve a list of CustomerOrder records associated with a particular Customer
 * @param {string} customerId Customer id
 * @param {Partial<OrderCollectionOptions>} opts Options for customizing the query
 */
export async function getCustomerOrders(customerId, opts = {}) {
  /** @type {OrderCollectionOptions} */

  // ! This is going to retrieve ALL ORDERS, not just the ones that belong to a particular customer. We'll need to fix this
  let options = {
    ...{ page: 1, perPage: 20, sort: 'shippeddate', order: 'asc' },
    ...opts
  };

  return getAllOrders(options, `WHERE customerid = '${customerId}'`);
}
```

## C) Querying Across Tables (5/6/19)
---
### Relationships & Joins
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sql-fundamentals/relationships-joins/

- he gave the examples of the orders, customers, employees
- the orders belongs to the customer and the customer has many orders
- the orders also belong to employee and employee has many orders

- the orders table would be a junction table containing the customerid and the employeeid

- *relational databases do not come from these relationships but from the relational algebra we covered at the beginning*

- **JOINS**
- the joining is done on a related column between the tables
- four types of join, that differ in terms of how "incomplete" matches are handled

- *INNER JOIN*
- TAKEAWAY: when we need exact matches of both the left table  and right table IE orders and customers
- only rows that have "both ends" of the match will be selected
- incomplete matches are completely omitted
- inner join will only give you complete matches

```sql
SELECT *
FROM CustomerOrder AS o
INNER JOIN Customer AS c
  ON o.customerid = c.id
```

- *LEFT JOIN*
- TAKEAWAY: appropriate when you're trying to resolve something on the left table
- rows from left of join will be selected no matter what

- *RIGHT JOIN*
- rows from right of join will be selected no matter what
- SQLite does not support right join because you can just do it with left joins from the other side

- *FULL JOIN*
- TAKEAWAY: good if you want to audit
- will include everything
- there will be gaps for ones that are incomplete
- we will use a foreign key to validate if a value exists, more to come

- **OUTER JOINS**
- LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL are referred as outer joins because one or more rows may be partially empty, due to not having a corresponding match in the other table


- **JOIN - SELECTING COLUMNS***
- important for us to use aliases since columns from different tables might have the same column name like `id`
- SELECT * is generally a bad idea, and it's particularly dangerous in the context of a JOIN
- choose columns with care, and alias any duplicates
```sql
SELECT o.id, o.customerid, o.amount, c.name
FROM CustomerORDER AS o
INNER JOIN Customer AS c
  on o.customerid = c.id
```

---
### JOIN Exercise (5/6/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sql-fundamentals/join-exercise/

- `npm run test:ex:watch 4`
- product list: suppliers, categories (replace supplier ids and category ids to suppliername and categoryname)
- order list: customers and employees (we want names instead of ids)
- order: customer, employee and products (replace customer id, employee id, and product ids to customer name, employeename, and productname)

- Alter the relevant queries to include one or more JOINs so that these Ids are replaced with the relevant human-readable name

- I didn't know how to do the exercise

---
### JOIN Solution (5/6/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sql-fundamentals/join-solution/

- **PRODUCTS SOLUTION**
- `p.*` means select all columns from p
```js
// products.js
export async function getAllProducts(opts = {}) {
  const db = await getDb();
  let whereClause = '';
  if (opts.filter && opts.filter.inventory) {
    switch (opts.filter.inventory) {
      case 'discontinued':
        whereClause = 'WHERE discontinued = 1';
        break;
      case 'needs-reorder':
        whereClause = 'WHERE discontinued = 0 AND ((unitsinstock + unitsonorder) < reorderlevel)';
        break;
    }
  }
  return await db.all(sql`
SELECT ${ALL_PRODUCT_COLUMNS.map(x => `p.${x}`).join(',')},
  s.contactname AS suppliername,
  c.categoryname
FROM Product AS p
LEFT JOIN Supplier AS s
  ON p.supplierid = s.id
LEFT JOIN Category as c
  ON p.categoryid = c.id
  ${whereClause}`);
}
```

- **ORDERS SOLUTION**
- there were a lot of things going on here, so rewatch the video
- it started failing ex 3 again
- the `map()` is a higher order function to tack on co. so it can clarify which table was aliased
```js
// orders.js
export async function getAllOrders(opts = {}, whereClause = '') {
  /** @type {OrderCollectionOptions} */
  let options = {
    ...DEFAULT_ORDER_COLLECTION_OPTIONS,
    ...opts
  };

  const db = await getDb();
  let sortClause = '';
  let paginationClause = '';

  if (options.sort && options.order) {
    sortClause = `ORDER BY co.${options.sort} ${options.order.toUpperCase()}`;
  }
  if (typeof options.page !== 'undefined' && options.perPage) {
    paginationClause = `LIMIT ${options.perPage} OFFSET ${(options.page - 1) * options.perPage}`;
  }

  return await db.all(sql`
SELECT ${ALL_ORDERS_COLUMNS.map(x => `co.${x}`).join(',')},
  c.companyname AS customername,
  e.lastname AS employeename
FROM CustomerOrder AS co
${whereClause}
LEFT JOIN Customer AS c ON co.customerid = c.id
LEFT JOIN Employee AS e ON co.employeeid = e.id
${sortClause}
${paginationClause}`);
}

export async function getOrder(id) {
  const db = await getDb();
  return await db.get(
    sql`
SELECT co.*,
  c.companyname AS customername,
  e.lastname AS employeename
FROM CustomerOrder as co
LEFT JOIN Customer AS c ON co.customerid = c.id
LEFT JOIN Employee AS e ON co.employeeid = e.id
WHERE co.id = $1`,
    id
  );
}

export async function getOrderDetails(id) {
  const db = await getDb();
  return await db.all(
    sql`
SELECT od.*, od.unitprice * od.quantity as price,
    p.productname
FROM OrderDetail AS od
LEFT JOIN Product AS p ON od.productid = p.id
WHERE od.orderid = $1`,
    id
  );
}
```

---
### Aggregate Functions and GROUP BY (5/7/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sql-fundamentals/aggregate-functions-and-group-by/

- perform a calculation on a set of values
- each RDBMS has its own functions
- like SUM, COUNT, MIN/MAX, AVG

- we could GROUP BY situations:
1) total spent by customerid
```sql
select c.id, c.name, sum(o.amount)
FROM CustomerOrder AS o
INNER JOIN Customer AS c
  ON o.customerid = c.id
GROUP BY c.id
```
2) total spent by month
```sql
SELECT month, sum(amount)
FROM CustomerOrder
GROUP BY month
```
3) total spent by customerid, by month
```sql
SELECT customerid, month, sum(amount)
FROM CustomerOrder
GROUP BY month, customerid
```

- **CAUTION**
- you need to tie in the `customerid` in this example since it doesn't know how it relates to the data
```sql
SELECT month, customerid, sum(amount)
FROM CustomerOrder
GROUP BY month

/* ERROR: column
"CustomerOrder.customerid"
must appear in the GROUP BY
clause or be used in an
aggregate function
*/
```

- there are many aggregate functions in different databases IE [PG Aggregate](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html)
- beware that some DB like MySQL doesn't aggregate in the same order so you have to set the order also

- **WHERE VS HAVING**
- `WHERE` clause is to examine individual row. It can't be used with an aggregate function.
- `HAVING` clause should be used instead and happens after the `GROUP BY`
- it's a 2nd filtering step essentially
- you can use both clauses in 1 query

```sql
-- Bad usage
SELECT month,
sum(amount) AS month_sum
FROM CustomerOrder
WHERE month_sum >= 300
GROUP BY month

-- Good usage
SELECT month,
sum(amount) AS month_sum
FROM CustomerOrder
GROUP BY month
HAVING sum(amount) >= 300
```

- **SUBQUERY**
- a select query that is nested in another query
- can't mutate data and can only select
- some RDBMS doesn't support ORDER BY within subquery

---

### Aggregate Functions and GROUP BY Exercise (5/7/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sql-fundamentals/aggregate-functions-and-group-by-exercise/

- `npm run test:ex:watch 5`
- use aggregate function and GROUP BY to calculate
1) Order: subtotal
2) Supplier: productlist (concatenate Product.productname strings)
3) Employee: ordercount
4) Customer: ordercount

---
### Aggregate Functions and GROUP BY Solution (5/7/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/sql-fundamentals/aggregate-functions-and-group-by-solution/

- **ORDERS SOLUTION**
```js
export async function getOrder(id) {
  const db = await getDb();
  return await db.get(
    sql`
SELECT co.*,
  c.companyname AS customername,
  e.lastname AS employeename,
  sum( (1-od.discount) * od.unitprice * od.quantity) AS subtotal
FROM CustomerOrder as co
LEFT JOIN Customer AS c ON co.customerid = c.id
LEFT JOIN Employee AS e ON co.employeeid = e.id
LEFT JOIN OrderDetail AS od ON od.orderid = co.id
WHERE co.id = $1
GROUP BY co.id, c.companyname, e.lastname`,
    id
  );
}
```

- **CUSTOMERS SOLUTION**
```js
export async function getAllCustomers(options = {}) {
  const db = await getDb();
  let whereClause = '';
  if (options.filter) {
    whereClause = `WHERE lower(companyname) LIKE lower('%${options.filter}%') OR
    lower(contactname) LIKE lower('%${options.filter}%')`;
  }
  return await db.all(sql`
SELECT ${ALL_CUSTOMERS_COLUMNS.map(x => `c.${x}`).join(',')},
  count(co.id) as ordercount
FROM Customer AS c
LEFT JOIN CustomerOrder AS co ON co.customerid = c.id
${whereClause}
GROUP BY c.id`);
}
```

- **EMPLOYEES SOLUTION**
```js
export async function getAllEmployees() {
  const db = await getDb();
  return await db.all(sql`
SELECT
  ${ALL_EMPLOYEES_COLUMNS.map(x => `e.${x}`).join(',')},
  count(co.id) AS ordercount
FROM Employee AS e
LEFT JOIN CustomerOrder AS co ON co.employeeid = e.id
GROUP BY e.id`);
}
```

- **SUPPLIES SOLUTION**
```js
export async function getAllSuppliers() {
  const db = await getDb();
  let productList = '';

  switch (process.env.DB_TYPE) {
    case 'mysql':
      productList = sql`group_concat(p.productname ORDER BY p.productname DESC SEPARATOR ', ')`;
      break;
    case 'pg':
      productList = sql`string_agg(p.productname, ', ')`;
      break;
    case 'sqlite':
    default:
      productList = sql`group_concat(p.productname, ', ')`;
      break;
  }

  return await db.all(sql`
SELECT ${ALL_SUPPLIERS_COLUMNS.map(x => `s.${x}`).join(',')},
  ${productList} AS productlist
FROM Supplier AS s
LEFT JOIN (SELECT * FROM Product ORDER BY productname DESC) AS p ON p.supplierid = s.id
GROUP BY s.id`);
}
```

# Introduction to Node.js /w Scott Moss
- [Github Repo](https://github.com/FrontendMasters/intro-node-js)
- [Slides](https://slides.com/scotups/deck/fullscreen)
- [Course Transcript](https://static.frontendmasters.com/assets/courses/2018-11-28-node-js/transcripts.zip)

## A) Introduction
---
### Course Overview (5/7/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/course-overview/

- course is based on javascript
- his approach is very practical

---
### What is Node.js (5/7/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/what-is-node-js/

- node.js is an environment to run javascript outside a browser
- open source runtime
- built on Chrome's V8 JS engine (like Mozilla's SpiderMonkey or Safari's WebKit)
- created by Ryan Dhal in 2009
- has evolved and has a huge community
- 90% of the packages exist already, cohesive environment with javascript
- it's not a complete package like ruby but most of the community has built similar packages in Node already

- **SINGLE THREAD**
- nodejs is not great for high CPU intense operations like large arithmetic, machine learning, or reading file systems synchronously
- single threaded with an event loop and asynchronous
- Python in comparison is multi-thread and blocking
- makes node good for high concurrency but bad on high CPU bound task

---
### Creating with Node.js (5/7/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/creating-with-node-js/

- pretty much anything a scripting language that Python or Ruby can, except with Javascript

- Tooling (build, automation, etc)
- API's (REST, Realtime, etc)
- can create REST APIs, GraphQL APIs, Web Sockets
- CDNs, use to be in a lower level language
- Shareable libraries, some people maintain libraries as their main job
- desktop applications
- IOT, raspberry pie and you can make anything
- Pretty much anything because node is on everything now

- **USING IN PRODUCTION AND SECURITY**
- Node have internal modules
- You have to rely on the community for other features
- takeway, if a package has a healthy following, it can be trustworthy
- big companies do you use NPMs
- other companies won't
- some people will fork it to add their own code
- you can also lock to current versions if you choose to

---
### Installing Node.js (5/7/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/installing-node-js/

- Install from node version manager
- Scott recommends use NVM going forward
- it allows you to have many versions of nodes and cause problem with permissions errors
- you need to be able to switch different versions for testing, deployment, etc.

- you can also use docker, another way to download everything

---
### Running Node.js Code (5/7/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/running-node-js-code/

- 2 ways to eval code
1) Interactive REPL - just for testing and playing around
- you just type `node` to start it
- then you can start writing javascript

2) CLI Executable - use to execute your node apps
- `node <path to your file>`

---
### Installing Node.js from the source (5/7/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/installing-node-js-from-the-source/

- recommends we use LTS or even versions since they have features that will be kept
- current node version in this video is 10

- he went through the website and showed how to install from the website

---
### Installing Node.js with NVM (5/7/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/installing-node-js-with-nvm/
- [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation)

- **INSTALL NVM**
- You just have to run the install script from that repo IE `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash`

- **INSTALL LATEST NODE**
- `nvm install node` to install node
- `nvm alias default node` helps you from having to type node <version #> everytime (I didn't have to do this)
- I installed v 12.2.0 and it also created default node version for me

---
### Install and Run Node.js Exercise (5/7/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/install-and-run-node-js-exercise/

1) Install nodejs
2) Verify Installation
3) Use the Node REPL and write some JS
4) Use the node CLI executable against a .js file

---
### Checking Install & Running Node.js Solution (5/7/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/checking-install-running-node-js-solution/

- use `which node` to see if you're using the nvm, it should have .nvm in the path
- by default, NVM should have deleted the other source Node installation for you
- he doesn't recommend using the older version of node

- `.bashrc` and `.bashprofile` are config files

- I had to add to my `.zshrc` file to make it run the scripts on every run for iTerm:
```
export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
```

- `touch` to create a new empty file
- `code` to open up the file

---
## B) Node.js Modules
---
### Browser JavaScript vs Node.js (5/8/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/browser-javascript-vs-node-js/
- [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/)

- **BROWSER VS NODEJS**
- *BROWSER*
- Browser builds interactive apps for the web
- DOM
- Window
- Fragmentation (Doesn't work on some browsers)
- optional modules (es6)
- cannot access filesystem
- async

- *NODE*
- Node build server side apps and scripts
- Nope, no GUI (can virtualize)
- No window, but does have a global
- Versioned, so no fragmentation
- required modules (commonjs+)
- can access filesystem
- async
- no browser based api

---
### Globals in Node.js (5/8/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/globals-in-node-js/

- node doesn't have a window but has a global
- do not create your own

- **POPULAR GLOBALS**
- *process* - has information about the environment that the program is running in
- *require* = function to find and use modules in current module, how you pull in packages aka import
- *__dirname* = the current directory path
- *module* = sibling of require, information about current module, methods for making module consumable, it's how you export packages
- *global* - like window, its the "global" object. Almost NEVER use this
- many more...

---
### Node.js Modules (5/8/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/node-js-modules/
- [CommonJS docs](https://requirejs.org/docs/commonjs.html)
- modules is packaged javascript and is encapsulated code
- there use to be the past about building modules in the past, now we have COMMONJS, AMD, ES6 Modules

- there more than 5 globals but the 5 most common ones that are wrapped with each files are: `exports`, `require`, `module`, `__filename`, `__dirname`
- these are injected to each file and there are specific to each instance of the file where are the other globals exist on the global scope like setTimout(),etc.

- You don't have to master commonjs because node is is moving over to es6
- modules is the only way to share code between files since we don't have script tags like in the browser

- **OTHER MODULES**
- ESM (exmascript modules) but needs a transpiler and it's the new standard going to replace commonjs
- AMD (pretty much dead)
- there are otheres but don't matter

---
### Creating Node Modules (5/8/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/creating-node-modules/

- all your node.js codes is already a module since it gets wrapped automatically like we talked in the previous lesson
- as the author, you decide how and what to expose from your modules, to other modules
- except when you test, you have to export everything

- **EXPORT EXAMPLE**
- you do this with the module global object provided you by the Nodejs runtime
- don't ever use `export` export
- there is no specific default export way to export everything but is possible
- can't export multiple modules in a file, the latest will overwrite previous
- but you can use `module.exports.more`

```js
const add = (num, num2) => {}
const notPublic = () => {}

module.exports = {add, thing() {}, value: 1}
```

---
### Importing Node Modules (5/8/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/importing-node-modules/

- use `require` to consume the modules
- Nodejs runtime injects another global you can use
- takes the relative path to the module and synchronously loads whatever the target module exports

- **EXAMPLE REQUIRE**
- the modules that you make, you have to put `./` in front of it
- node will create a tree to pull in needed modules and pulls everything needed before it runs `lib.action()` function
- usually there is only one entry point in your app, usually `app.js`

```js
//lib.js
module.exports = {
  value: 1,
  userIds: [1,2,3],
  action() {
    console.log('action')
  }
}

// app.js
const lib = require('./lib')
lib.action()
```

---
### Q&A: ES Modules & Latest JS Features (5/8/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/q-a-es-modules-latest-js-features/

- you can use `webpack`, `parcel`, `browserify`, or `rollup` as a bundling tool to convert code for the web to understand for different browsers
- Scott said that most of the time you only need `babel` and `typescript` with node but you can also use webpack with it
- most of the time you don't need a bundled app with node

- io.js was the predecessor to Node since they supported all the latest javascript updates, then io.js got merged into node.js
- the problem now is having Node converted over to ES modules from commonjs modules without break past apps

---
### Convert Browser JavaScript Exercise (5/8/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/convert-browser-javascript-exercise/

- fork the repo
- checkout `start` branch
- check README on how to run test on exerise 2
- task: fix and convert 3 js files in the exercises/modules/browser to Nodejs JavaScript and place them in exercises/modules/node
- ensure all the tests pass

- *hints*
- order of scripts matter in html file: data, api, app
- paste code in browser folder files into node folder files
- use `npx jest` to run to test, add `--verbose` if you want to see the name of the tests
- npx shipped with node

- **MY ATTEMPT**
- 6 tests passed
```js
// data.js
module.exports = {
	users: [{ id: 1, name: 'Weezy' }],
	posts: [
		{ title: 'yo', body: 'I ate today', createdBy: 1 },
		{ title: 'Me', body: 'Look at my selfie', createdBy: 1 },
		{ title: 'My doggy', body: 'my dog is better than yours', createdBy: 1 }
	]
};

// api.js
const data = require('./data');

const getUserById = (id, cb) => {
	// simulate API call
	setTimeout(() => {
		const user = data.users.find(user => user.id === id);
		cb(user);
	}, 150);
};

const getPostsForUser = (userId, cb) => {
	// simulate API call
	setTimeout(() => {
		const posts = data.posts.filter(post => post.createdBy === userId);
		cb(posts);
	}, 150);
};

module.exports = { getUserById, getPostsForUser };

// app.js
const { getUserById, getPostsForUser } = require('./api');

const showPostsForCurrentUser = (userId, cb) => {
	getPostsForUser(userId, posts => {
		const postTemplates = posts.map(post => {
			return `
      <div class="post">
        ${post.title}
        ${post.body}
        ${post.createdBy}
      </div>`;
		});
		cb(postTemplates);
	});
};

const showUserProfile = (userId, cb) => {
	getUserById(userId, user => {
		const profile = `
      <div>
        ${user.name}
      </div>
    `;
		cb(user);
	});
};

module.exports = { showPostsForCurrentUser, showUserProfile };
```

---
### Convert Browser JavaScript Solution (5/8/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/convert-browser-javascript-solution/

- we ran `npx jest` but we didn't learn npm yet
- we just used a remote module called `jest`
- node ships with NPM binary and NPX binary
- npx allows you to run locally cli files installed in the project as global cli
- so instead of typing the FULL path to the jest module in the node_modules directory, they built `npx` command to search and run it

---
## C) Internal Modules & npm
---
### The fs Module (5/9/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/the-fs-module/

- **COMMON SHIPPED MODULES**
- there are modules that come shipped with Node
- `fs` - how to interact with files
- to reference them as an internal module, you use `require` and there's no dot
```js
const fs = require('fs');

const file = fs.readFileSync('./lib.js', {encoding: 'utf-8'}).toString() // reading a file

fs.writeFileSync('./lib.js', 'var me= "me"') // writing a file
```

- *reading vs requiring it with a module system is that requiring will execute the file where as reading is just getting the string*
- behavior of Node for synchronous vs async is the same as the browser
- however, async is more important in Node

- there are a lot of CLIs that are being made with FS
- there are many other things to do especially if you're going to do automation tools

---
### Other Internal Node Modules (5/9/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/other-internal-node-modules/

- *modules work differently depending on what version of Node you're using*

- `http` - low level-ish mdule for creating network based programs, like APIS
- you will never almost never use this directly but might use other modules that use this
- it's very difficult to manage
-

- `path` - useful for manipulating path strings and handling differenes across many OS's
- you use it basically any time you are using a path in a file other than the require module
- the problem is that mac, windows, linux has different ways to write paths
- works hand in hand with fs module
- add `const path = require('path')`

### Remote Modules (5/9/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/remote-modules/

- modules downloaded from the internet that someone else has made
- the community has contributed tremendous growth to share/consume modules
- apps can be built quickly by reusing public modules
- beware of malicious code
- you need a system to help with management of remote modules (downloading, publishing, updating, etc.)

### Modules Recap (5/9/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/modules-recap/

- we talked about self-created modules, shipped modules, and remote modules
- *CAUTION: don't use remote modules that have the same name as internal modules because they probably contain malicious code*

- **EXAMPLES OF USING MODULES**
```js
var lib = require('../rel/path/to/lib') // for custom local modules, make sure to use "." first

var lib = require('lib') // remote module

var fs = require('fs') // internal module
```

### NPM (5/9/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/npm/
- [Left Pad Article](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/)

- NPM is node package manager
- ships with nodes by default
- allows you to publish, download, and update modules
- uses `package.json` file in your Nodejs project to determine dependencies, basically contains all the meta info
- `node_modules` is the directory where all your packages are kept

- we went over strategies to make sure a module is legitimate
- you shouldn't ever check in node modules into git, only the `package.json`
- you would also have to use `--save` flag to save a package to save it to package.json for other users
- `npm install` to install all the packages

---
### YARN (5/10/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/yarn/

- Yarn is the same tool as NPM and easier to use
- made by facebook
- you use `yarn add` instead
- Yarn also had CDN to cache things, now NPM is doing it too
- Yarn at the time also had version locking mechanism
- it's related to yarnlock and npmlock files

---
### CLI with Node Exercise (5/10/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/cli-with-node-exercise/

- we are going to create a CLI program
- it saves and retrieves contacts from and address book

1) ✅ checkout to start branch
2) ✅ install all remote modules (hint: use npm)
3) ✅ Check the README on how to run your CLI
4) ✅ Fix the CLI so that the "new" command works by saving contacts to contacts.json
5) ✅ Fix the CLI so that the "list" command works by listing all contacts and allowing you to select one, the prints out the selected contact

- `node exercises/cli/index.js new`
- `node exercises/cli/index.js list`
- we have to type out of the full path since we haven't packaged it up yet

- **MY ATTEMPT**
```js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// this path needs to be relative to work with fs
const contactsLocation = './contacts.json';

/**
 * should read the contacts at the
 * @contactsLocation path and convert
 * it to a js object
 */
const getContacts = () => {
	const file = fs
		.readFileSync(contactsLocation, { encoding: 'utf-8' })
		.toString();
	return JSON.parse(file);
};

/**
 * takes a contacts object, converts it to JSON
 * and saves it at the @contactsLocation path
 * @param {Object} contacts contacts object
 */
const saveContacts = contacts => {
	const newContacts = JSON.stringify(contacts);
	return fs.writeFileSync(contactsLocation, newContacts);
};

module.exports = {
	contactsLocation,
	getContacts,
	saveContacts
};
```

---
### CLI with Node Solution (5/10/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/cli-with-node-solution/
- [JSON Stringify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify)
- [Path internal module docs](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/path.html#path_path_join_paths)

- Talked about `SymVer` for node packages
- it is a system that open source developers use to release their packages
`^1.18.3` = 1st num means major change, 2nd means additional or fix change, 3 means patches or minors

- we had to make sure to install `commander` and `inquirer` packages in `./cli/index.js` file
- then we had to fix `utils.js`

- path.join will connect the full path and file name for you so no relative paths are needed
- a small trick to get JSON to format nicely is to use `JSON.stringify(contacts, null, 2)`

- the difference between `path.resolve` vs `path.join`
- resolve will look many levels upwards to find the correct path
- join will help only to correct a generally correct path for you

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

// this path needs to be relative to work with fs
const contactsLocation = path.join(__dirname, 'contacts.json');

/**
 * should read the contacts at the
 * @contactsLocation path and convert
 * it to a js object
 */
const getContacts = () => {
	const contacts = fs.readFileSync(contactsLocation).toString();
	return JSON.parse(contacts);
};

/**
 * takes a contacts object, converts it to JSON
 * and saves it at the @contactsLocation path
 * @param {Object} contacts contacts object
 */
const saveContacts = contacts => {
	return fs.writeFileSync(contactsLocation, JSON.stringify(contacts, null, 2));
};

module.exports = {
	contactsLocation,
	getContacts,
	saveContacts
};
```

---
### Commander Module for Building CLIs (5/10/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/commander-module-for-building-clis/

- `commander` is a hack around process and helps build out your CLI commands
- `inquirer` is the package that ask you all the questions
- inquirer uses the `prompts.js` to load up the question
- argv are all the arguments you passed in
- the 1st argument is always the path to the executable
- the 2nd argument is always the path that is currently executing
- after that is basically all the arguments you passed in

---
## D) Asynchronous Node
---
### Asynchronous Code in Node.js (5/11/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/commander-module-for-building-clis/

- ruby or python is multi-threaded
- javascript is single-threaded and a single event loop just like a browser, and allows for high concurrency
- callbacks, promises, async/await are ways we get notified of the results and dealing with this async behavior
- nodejs app with be shared by all clients
- now you have consider event loops that are CPU-intensive that block a single thread

---
### Asynchronous Patterns (5/11/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/asynchronous-patterns/
- [Promises.all MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all)

- use async/await and it works great
- async/await needs a try/catch block for handling errors
- async/await is not truly blocking because if other requests were to come in and the current async/await request won't block that one
- so it is still an asynchronous operation

- the general patterns are:
```js
// CALLBACKS
// callback takes error as first arg, and result as second
doAsyncThing((error, result) => {})

// PROMISES
doAsyncThing()
  .then(result => {})
  .catch(error => {})

// ASYNC/AWAIT
const run = async () => {
  const results = await doAsyncThing() // must return a promise
  console.log('hello')
}
```
- `promise.all` is a really good control flow for a group of promises
- `bluebird` and other libraries are useful for promise controls also

---
### Error Handling (5/11/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/error-handling/

- any thrown or unhandled errors will cause the process to crash and exit
- think of a server and if it crashes, all the users can't access your app

- you app may have errors that should not cause a crash, so you must handle accordingly
- so if there's an invalid authentication token or something from a user, you don't want your whole app to crash and notify the user

---
### Servers (5/11/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/servers/

- a server's job is to handle a request from some sort of client (browser, mobile app, another server, etc)

- without considering scaling, one server instance will handle many client requests.

- nodejs has built in and community packages for building all types of servers (API's, static, realtime, etc.)

---
### Asynchronous Server Exercise (5/11/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/asynchronous-server-exercise/

- Exercise 4: refactoring and fixing a simple static asset server
- ✅ install all remote modules (hint: use npm)
- ✅ Check the README on how to run your server
- ✅ refactor the sync file reading code to be async with a callback, promise, or async await
- ✅ prevent the server from crashing when an assets is not found. Instead, respond with a 404 status code
- ✅ create some sort of router logic to handle incoming requests for assets

- we are in `./exercises/api/server.js` and exercise 4
- we need to turn the findAsset function to be async
- it won't seem like it's blocking since we don't have many operations going on like a big server
- start the server with `node exercises/api/server.js`

- **MY ATTEMPT**
- doesn't work, just an attempt
```js
const http = require('http');
const url = require('url');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

/**
 * this function is blocking, fix that
 * @param {String} name full file name of asset in asset folder
 */
const findAsset = async name => {
	const assetPath = await path.join(__dirname, 'assets', name);
	return fs.readFileSync(assetPath, { encoding: 'utf-8' }).toString();
};

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

// log incoming request coming into the server. Helpful for debugging and tracking
const logRequest = (method, route, status) =>
	console.log(method, route, status);

const server = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
	const method = req.method;
	const route = await url.parse(req.url).pathname;
	// this is sloppy, espcially with more assets, create a "router"
	try {
		switch (route) {
			case '/':
				res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
				res.write(findAsset('index.html'));
				logRequest(method, route, 200);
				res.end();
				break;
		}
	} catch (err) {
		res.status(404).json(err);
		return res.end();
	}
	// most important part, send down the asset
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
	console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

---
### Asynchronous Server Solution (5/11/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/asynchronous-server-solution/

- a mime type is the information about what type of file is being serve so the browser can interpret it
- `mime` npm package is a useful way to figure out what mime type something is
- installed it and use `.getType()` to determine file type in code

- TIP: server your static assets from a CDN

- You can also use promisify utility
- [util promisify](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/util.html#util_util_promisify_original)
```js
const http = require('http');
const url = require('url');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const mime = require('mime');

/**
 * this function is blocking, fix that
 * @param {String} name full file name of asset in asset folder
 */
const findAsset = name => {
	const assetPath = path.join(__dirname, 'assets', name);
	return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
		fs.readFile(assetPath, { encoding: 'utf-8' }, (error, result) => {
			if (error) {
				reject(error);
			} else {
				resolve(result);
			}
		});
	});
};

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;
const router = {
	'/ GET': {
		asset: 'index.html',
		mime: mime.getType('html')
	},
	'/style.css GET': {
		asset: 'style.css',
		mime: mime.getType('css')
	}
};

// log incoming request coming into the server. Helpful for debugging and tracking
const logRequest = (method, route, status) =>
	console.log(method, route, status);

const server = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
	const method = req.method;
	const route = url.parse(req.url).pathname;
	const match = router[`${route} ${method}`];

	// this is sloppy, espcially with more assets, create a "router"
	if (!match) {
		res.writeHead(404);
		logRequest(method, route, 404);
		return res.end();
	}
	res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': match.mime });
	res.write(await findAsset(match.asset));
	logRequest(method, route, 200);
	res.end();
	// most important part, send down the asset
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
	console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

### Debugging Node (5/14/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/debugging-node/

- debugging is just like chrome
- LEVEL 1: console.log your way through and record your logs
- there are a lot of tools for it
- you would use this locally

- LEVEL 2: use your node inspector when starting your app and debug like you would a browser app in chrome
- add `--inspect` to your terminal like `node --inspect exercises/api/server.js`
- the debugger will listen on the websocket
- you can type in `chrome://inspect`, you can see Remote Target, click on inspect
- you can use it to debug live

- LEVEL 3: Text editor integration offers the most seamless experience
- set it up in like VS Code, Atom, Webstorm
- you can use `debugger`

---
### Testing Node Libraries (5/14/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/testing-node-libraries/

- Node testing has become a lot easier!
- tests themselves are executed in Nodejs

- you still have to export modules if you want to test them
- there are other concerns specific to what libraries and frameworks you use like mocks, spies, stubs

- you can test everything in node, even a browser app that test stuff on the DOM
- Browser apps, API's, CLI's, scripts, tools, etc.
- `js-dom` is another package that mocks DOM out
- you can even test animations

---
### Anatomy of Tests (5/14/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/anatomy-of-tests/

- there's your code to be tested
- `test suite` helps organize tests, provide hooks, and overall environments
- `assertion library` does actual comparison in your tests
- `mocks and spies` are tools to test your code without testing other code or actually running your code
- spies is a way to test an internal function or a callback function
- really advance concepts and might not need to get to this point

---
### Types of Tests (5/14/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/types-of-tests/
- [PhantomJS](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs)
- [Headless Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/06/headless-karma-mocha-chai)

- if you can write it, you can test it

- `unit` is testing small blocks of code and not how all the code works as a whole
- easiest to do and force you to write clean code
- writing good unit tests can go far

- `integration` is testing how things work with each other

- `end to end` is testing the whole process from the client to the server and back
- depends on your education

- `UI` is like e2e but for the user interface

- `snapshot` is take a picture of the DOM

- `performance` is testing speed and ability like load testing

- there are many more...

---
### Debugging & Testing Exercise (5/14/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/debugging-testing-exercise/
- [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/)

- use debug to track down issues in small app
- use logging and inspector
- try to fix and write tests to make sure it stays fixed

- **EXERCISE 5 TASKS**
1) ✅ checkout to start branch
2) ✅ check the README on how to execute this program and run test
3) ✅ there are 3 bugs, find them and fix them
4) ✅ write some unit test with Jest to make sure those bugs stay fixed. Refactor the code if you have to

- **MY ATTEMPT**
- open `exercise/testing/users.js`
- there are some problems here
- run server with `node exercises/testing/index.js`
- tried but did not know

---
### Debugging & Testing Solution (5/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/debugging-testing-solution/

- it's difficult to debug another person's code
- walk through every single line of code

- can throw `debugger` and run `node --inspect exercises/testing/index.js`
- we can click on inspect
- now run a query and debug through it

- first error was `req.id` needed a `.params`
- second error was passing `user => user.id === _id` into the `findUser()` function which takes in an id
- third error was was that id is a string by default so we needed to parseInt with the `fixId()` function
```js
// api.js
app.get('/user/:id', async (req, res) => {
	const id = req.params.id; // ERROR 1
	// should ge user by given id in route param
	const user = await users.findUser(id); // ERROR 2
	res.status(200).send(user);
});

// user.js
const fixId = id => parseInt(id);
// simulate async db call with promise
const findUser = id =>
	new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
		const _id = fixId(id);
		const user = users.find(user => user.id === _id); // ERROR 3
		if (user) {
			return resolve(user);
		}
		reject(new Error(`No user with id "${_id}"`));
	});
```

---
## F) Publishing and Deploying
---
### Sharing Modules (5/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/sharing-modules/

- **SHARING YOUR MODULES IS EASY**
- TLDR: you publish it to github and npm

- add node_modules to gitignore
- declare remote modules as devDependencies if you only need them to develop with (like Jest)

- think about how your module is being used and if it needs dependencies
- if it does, think about how your host app might already have it (NPM tries to fix versions for you, but don't rely on this always working)
- most of the time, just make it a devDependency

- think is it private or public
- if it's private, you might need a token

---
### Deploying Your Servers (5/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/deploying-your-servers/
- [Process Env Docs](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_env)

- follow cloud provider instructions, and never hard code environment variables
- most cloud providers have their own method of deploying apps and integrate with Github/CLI assistant

- **THINGS TO REMEMBER**
- setup a CI flow for your app
- remove secretes and use env vars
- make sure you are developing with same version of node locally and on your server
- this is where NVM comes in

- **STATIC SITE GENERATOR VS STATIC SITE SERVER**
- SSG's takes data from server/JSON/markdown and outputs html/css with a templating engine (React, Angular, GatsbyJS)
- SSS's is a server on the cloud that serves files
- this is much slower than a CDN
- don't recommend that we read a file with node and try to cache it (basically you're just building a cdn)
---
### Deploying to Heroku (5/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/deploying-to-heroku/
- [Getting started with heroku and node](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)

- he walked through deploying to heroku
- he was using the REST API
- heroku also has a procfile to how to start things

- `npm publish` will try to publish a package to NPM
- there's a lot of work beforehand

- if it's a private/scoped module, it is usually prefaced with `@name/lodash` for example
- all private modules are scoped by default

---
### Further Tools & Resources (5/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/further-tools-resources/

- learn Babel
- if you're trying to build APIs, learn express
- if you're trying to learn some front end tools and optimizations, learn Webpack
- if you're trying to build CLIs, learn Commander
- explore npm and contribute to npm

---
### Final Q&A (5/15/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/node-js/final-q-a/

- tipe.io is a CMS that is built with node
- CMSs are difficult because of the data model and database choice
- node on the server is good now because you would be able to do things from PHP/Wordpress world like A/B testing

- GatsbyJS is just a static site generator
- NextJS and Nuxt are more for dynamic applications
- Nuxt also allows static site generation

# Introduction to MongoDB w/ Scott Moss

## A) Introduction
---
### Course Setup (5/18/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/mongodb/course-setup/
- [Course Repo](https://github.com/FrontendMasters/intro-mongo-db)
- [MongoDB Setup](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)
- [MongDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/compass)

- Download the repo

- **MONGODB SETUP**
- pick Community Server and use homebrew to install
- run `mongod` to check if it runs
- run `mongo` to open up the MongoDB shell

- **MONGO SHELL COMMANDS**
- `show dbs` shows all the databases existing on your computer
- default are admin, config, and local
- `use todos` will create and switch to a new database
- `show collections` should not show errors if you have installed correctly
- `db.help()` shows you all available methods
- `db.createCollection('items')` to create a new collection

- **MONGODB COMPASS SETUP**
- this is the GUI and download the community version for free
- open the GUI
- connect to local host by default and shows all the local databases that you have

---
### Mongo Q&A (5/18/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/mongodb/mongo-q-a/
- [MongDB repository](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

- mostly written in C++

- **PROS**
- Mongo was easier to start with
- it's very flexible
- data is JSON by default but querying is much easier
- built with javascript/node in mind, takes advantage of event base architecture
- it's promise based
- now becoming ASIC compliant

- **CONS**
- SQL and PostgreSQL performs better at the top level
- has not been out as long

- **WHY MONGO VS RELATIONAL DB**
- Mongo is good for simple app
- Mongo is more forgiving for CMS apps since you don't have to run tons of migration
- Good for real time applications for chatting
- You shouldn't use it for a social network, a graph, time-series
- perfect for eCommerce applications
- you can store data any way you want and validate too

---
## B) Mongoose
---
### Schemas & Why Mongoose (5/18/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/mongodb/schemas-why-mongoose/
- [Mongoose ORM](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- schemas are a way to validate data and keep your data consistent
- it does not make it a relational database

- **HOW TO CONNECT TO MONGO FROM NODE APP**
- 1) native MongoDB driver or 2) Mongoose
- Mongoose is Object Relational Mapper (ORM), synonymous like Sequelize or Bookshelf for PostgresQL
- Mongoose is the de facto ORM for Mongo and supports newer features than MongoDB driver
- Mongoose is better than DynomoDB

---
### Connecting to the Database (5/18/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/mongodb/connecting-to-the-database/

- make a new `test.js` in the root of the practice repo
- returns a promise by default
- there are other options but dependent on your needs
- you might get a lot of warnings about deprecation warnings because mongoose is lagging behind
- try your best to adhere to the warnings
```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const connect = () => {
  return mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/whatever') // the protocol for URL, hostname, explicit port with 27017 being default, name of the database
}
```

---
### Creating Schemas & Models (5/18/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/mongodb/creating-schemas-models/

- **CREATING A COLLECTION**
- a schema doesn't do any but just a scaffold
- can use javascript primitives in Mongo
- models will help set up out database
- CONVENTION:first argument in `mongoose.model` should be lower-cased and singular since mongoose will pluralrize it for us
- CONVENTION: capitalize first lete for models
```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const connect = () => {
  return mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/whatever')
}

const student = new mongoose.Schema({
  firstName: String
})

const Student = mongoose.model('student', student) // collection, schema
```

---
### Creating a Mongo Document (5/18/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/mongodb/creating-a-mongo-document/
- [Launch Rocket](https://github.com/jimbojsb/launchrocket)

- **INSERTING SOME QUERIES**
- connect to a database before interacting
- create a new student by declaring it
```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose')

const connect = () => {
  return mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/whatever')
}

const student = new mongoose.Schema({
  firstName: String
})

const Student = mongoose.model('student', student)

connect()
  .then(async connection => {
    const student = await Student.create({firstName: 'Tim'})
    console.log(student)
  })
  .catch(e => console.error(e))
```

- **RUNNING YOUR SERVER & LAUNCH ROCKET**
- Launch Rocket is a GUI that lists all your services and you can start it
- works only if you install with brew
- you can still run your server by running `mongod`
- execute the file with `node test.js`

---
### Deconstructing the Mongoose Document (5/18/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/mongodb/deconstructing-the-mongoose-document/

- `_id` is created by default for every document created, value is an `object id` (from BSON, its an object representation of id)
- object id's are very recognizable

- `firstName` was our schema

- `__v` is the version of your schema
- you will never have to use it really
- it doesn't really have a point
- you can also strip it out of migration

- a `mongoose document` is not a javascript object and has methods on it,  but we won't be able to see it
- there are other properties because those properties won't log and not enumerable
- later we will learn to convert it to JSON
- passing around regular javascript objects is faster than mongoose document
- mongo just uses JSON, mongoose provides tools/methods/helpers that is added on top of JSON

---
### Mongoose Schemas (6/11/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/mongodb/mongoose-schemas/

- **VALIDATION**
- `required` is a validation, `unique` is an index
```js
// test.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const connect = () => {
	return mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/whatever');
};

const student = new mongoose.Schema({ // added firstName, favFoods, and info validations
	firstName: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true
  },
  favFoods: [{type: String}],
  info: {
    school: {
      type: String
    },
    shoeSize: {
      type: Number
    }
  }
});

const Student = mongoose.model('student', student);

connect()
	.then(async connection => {
		const student = await Student.create({ firstName: 'Tim' });
		console.log(student);
	})
	.catch(e => console.error(e));

```

---
### Basic Query Methods (6/11/19)
- https://frontendmasters.com/courses/mongodb/basic-query-methods/

- **METHODS**
- `.find()` returns a list
- mongo doesn't return an error, just return a null if something doesn't exist
- `findByIdAndRemove`, `findByIdAndUpdate`, `findByIdAndDelete` are helpful for CRUD operations
- you can also make your own methods but there are many already
- leave object empty if you want to search by wildcard
- text index is an advance search method but there are better tools out there
- by default, mongo doesn't have timestamps but mongoose does the timestamps if you pass the command
```js
// test.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const connect = () => {
	return mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/whatever');
};

const student = new mongoose.Schema({
	firstName: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true
  },
  favFoods: [{type: String}],
  info: {
    school: {
      type: String
    },
    shoeSize: {
      type: Number
    }
  }
}, {timestamps: true}); // tells you when was created and deleted

const Student = mongoose.model('student', student);

connect()
	.then(async connection => {
    const student = await Student.create({ firstName: 'Tim' });
    const found = await Student.find({firstName: 'this'}) // returns a list
    const foundById = await Student.findById('asdfasdfasdf') // searches by id
    const updated = await Student.findByIdAndUpdate('asdfads', {}) // 2nd object is what to update
		console.log(student);
	})
	.catch(e => console.error(e));

```
