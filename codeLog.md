## Day 7: 11/25/19
- **Today's Progress**:
- Worked through "10 Days of Javascript" on HackerRank, day 9

- Not finished yet
- **Thoughts**:
- I tried adding click event listeners after looping through a `querySelectorAll` but didn't work
- End up having to manually attaching an event listener to each selector manually

## Day5: 11/23/19
- **Today's Progress**:
- Worked through "10 Days of Javascript" on HackerRank, day 7
- Read through articles about regular expressions
- **Thoughts**:
- Define regex pattern by setting to a new variable or use `new RegExp(/pattern/flags)`
- Regex literal:`const re = /\d+/g`
- Regex object: `const re = new RegExp('\\d+', 'g')`
- A character class is used in brackets to define one or more characters (Use ., \d, \D, \w, \W, \s, \S)
- Boundaries are used to set limits around the string (Use ^, S, \b, \B)
- RegExp methods (test, exec) or string methods (match, search, split, replace)
- Capturing groups use parentheses and remembers the match
- use `\1` to backreference the first capture group
- See [article](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-regexp-1/topics/javascript-regex)

## Day4: 11/21/19
- **Today's Progress**:
- Worked through "10 Days of Javascript" on HackerRank, day 6
- Read through articles about bitwise operators and javascript dates
- **Thoughts**:
- Learned about Bitwise Operators and conversion between binary/decimal
- From decimal to binary, use `(n).toString(2)`
- From binary to decimal, use `parstInt(n, 2)`
- Learn to use `new Date()`, then using `date.getDay()` to get numeral of day of the week
