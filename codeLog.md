## Day: 11/28/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked on Warm-up Challenges: Counting Valleys
### Thoughts:
- This challenge seemed hard at first but the solution was more simple than I had originally thought
- I thought I would have to keep track of the time it goes down, then make sure the ascent number equals out
- All I had to do was check the sea level and the ascent direction is up
- You'll understand if you look at my cold

## Day9: 11/27/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked on Warm-up Challenges: Sock Merchant
### Thoughts:
- I had a difficult time at first since I didn't think of sorting the input first
- Once it's sorted, it's easy to determine the number of matching socks
- This is good practice because HackerRank makes you think from different angles

## Day8: 11/26/19
### Today's Progress:
- Finished day 10 and completed "10 Days of Javascript" on HackerRank
- Went through [Typescript's 5 minute tutorial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html)
### Thoughts
- The calculator javascript code wasn't as difficult
- I remember in the past that using eval() method was easy but unsecure
- This was just a matter of splitting the numbers and operation sign, converting to binary, then do the operation, and converting back to base-10
- Typescript seems easy with the tutorial but I need to explore further
- I'd like to practice more emmet abbreviations as well > [Useful Cheatsheet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/)

## Day7: 11/25/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked through "10 Days of Javascript" on HackerRank, day 9
- Implemented display to show numbers when clicked on button
- Not finished yet
### Thoughts
- I tried adding click event listeners after looping through a `querySelectorAll` but didn't work
- End up having to manually attaching an event listener to each selector manually

## Day6: 11/24/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked through "10 Days of Javascript" on HackerRank, day 8
### Thoughts
- It was cool to jump back into some vanilla javascript for once
- The challenges themselves weren't too interesting
mselves weren't toointeresting

## Day5: 11/23/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked through "10 Days of Javascript" on HackerRank, day 7
- Read through articles about regular expressions
### Thoughts
- Define regex pattern by setting to a new variable or use `new RegExp(/pattern/flags)`
- Regex literal:`const re = /\d+/g`
- Regex object: `const re = new RegExp('\\d+', 'g')`
- A character class is used in brackets to define one or more characters (Use ., \d, \D, \w, \W, \s, \S)
- Boundaries are used to set limits around the string (Use ^, S, \b, \B)
- RegExp methods (test, exec) or string methods (match, search, split, replace)
- Capturing groups use parentheses and remembers the match
- use `\1` to backreference the first capture group
- See [article](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-regexp-1/topics/javascript-regex)

## Day4: 11/21/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked through "10 Days of Javascript" on HackerRank, day 6
- Read through articles about bitwise operators and javascript dates
### Thoughts
- Learned about Bitwise Operators and conversion between binary/decimal
- From decimal to binary, use `(n).toString(2)`
- From binary to decimal, use `parseInt(n, 2)`
- Learn to use `new Date()`, then using `date.getDay()` to get numeral of day of the week

## Day3: 11/20/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked through "10 Days of Javascript" on HackerRank, day 5
- Read through articles about inheritance, template literals, and arrow functions
