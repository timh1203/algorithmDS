## Day35: 12/23/19
### Today's Progress:
- Work on full stack app to connect client and server
- Setup a local database for psql, dotenv, actions&reducers, and saving db profile
### Thoughts:
- Learned that I was able to make requests from server because of proxy
- This helps prevents CORS issues because client and server essentially originate from the same `localhost:5000`
- Learned that ORM sequelize is a middle man and has its own language
- I would rather have SQL skills transfer than ORM skills, more resources for SQL than ORM, more granular control
- Redux Form, a popular library, is also another level of complexity isn't needed
- Useful psql commands: `CREATE DATABASE <db name>:`, `\c <dbname>`, `\dt`

## Day 32: 12/20/19
### Today's Progress:
- Finished building the react app with hooks, reducer, and context
### Thoughts:
- Wow, I learned a great deal going through this and cool to see how everything fits together
- My understanding is that `useReducer` is used to sync data with the redux store, therefore making data global scoped
- `useContext` is used to access the global data and have state persist between components
- My question now: How and should I even use hooks/reducer/context to replace Redux?

---
## Day31: 12/19/19
### Today's Progress:
- Continue with building the react app, learned about context API, react hooks, useState(), useEffect(), useReducer()
### Thoughts:
- Started a new repository for comparison purposes with normal react/redux pattern
- Learned how to make a global state with context and useReducer()
- If I had to say, Hooks is so much easier to set up than redux in my opinion but I still have not used Hooks in production yet
- Context is a way to pass down data to deeply nested children components

### Thoughts:
- This problem used singly linked-list which made conceptually challenging for code implementation
- Finished the section on authentication and learned a lot about how authentication flow is suppose to work
- Again, rushed through it at the workplace since we were under time constraints
- To see the proper flow helps tremendously in seeing how all the parts fit together

### Today's Progress:
- Finished on "Count Triplets" from Hash Tables section of Interview Prep Kit
- Worked on "Build a survey form" project, finished all user stories (16 total user stories)
### Thoughts:
- This algorithm was truly hard for me and had to get some help
- I learned the use of JS ES6 Maps which was pretty cool
- I didn't expect how usefulness of a data structure
- Reviewed different form types besides text: `number`, `checkbox`, `radio`
- There's many other types I didn't use but are interested in: `date`, `datetime-local`, `file`, `range`, `tel`, `url`, `week`, and the list goes on
- Now just have to style my app

### Today's Progress:
- Working on "Count Triplets" from Hash Tables section of Interview Prep Kit
- Started on "Build a survey form" project, finished 6 user stories (16 total user stories)
### Thoughts:
- Got the basic cases working but having difficulty when `r` is 1
- So far so good on the project, I'm trying to be mindful to use the new html tags that I learned in the previous lessons like `<main>` or `<section>`

- Finished "Applied Accessibility" section of Responsive Web Design Certification (22 challenges)
### Thoughts:
- Learning about using different html tags properly: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`
- New things I learned: `<audio>`, `<source>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, `<time>`, `<datetime>`
- Setting for hiding elements meant for only screen readers:
```css
.sr-only {
  position: absolute;
  left: -10000px;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  top: auto;
  overflow: hidden;
}

## Day19: 12/7/19
### Today's Progress:
- Solved "Two Strings" from Hash Tables section of Interview Prep Kit
### Thoughts:
- This challenge was not difficult, it was worth it not to overthink the solution
- I just check for letters from string1 in string2, instead of worrying about all combinations of substrings

## Day18: 12/6/19
### Today's Progress:
- Solved "Ransom Note" from Hash Tables section of Interview Prep Kit
- Finished "Applied Visual Design" section of Responsive Web Design Certification (52 challenges)
### Thoughts:
- The problem wasn't too difficult
- I learned differences between `.find()`, `.findIndex()`, `.filter()`, `.indexOf()`, `.lastIndexOf()`, `.includes()`, `.some()`
- I also learned that I should check for negative returns IE `exists !== -1`
- I'll have to make a blog post of this
- I learned so many things in the Applied Visual Design section including bezier curves, animations, gradients, keyframes, and creating complex shapes
- Definitely have to review this section again since it has so many cool stuff

## Day17: 12/5/19
### Today's Progress:
- Solved "Minimum Swaps 2" from Array section of Interview Prep Kit
- Finished "Basic CSS" section of Responsive Web Design Certification (44 challenges)
### Thoughts:
- Algorithm was confusing initially but I wrote it out on paper
- It started making more sense and I wrote this algorithm accordingly
- `indexOf` takes a second argument to start searching from second argument
- `indexOf` returns the first matching index which the element can be found (IE string, number), or else returns -1
- EXAMPLE: `array.indexOf('bison')`
- `findIndex` returns the first matching index in array matching the condition, or else returns -1
- EXAMPLE: `array.findIndex(item => item > 13)`
- Learned CSS variables: declartion => `--penguin-skin: gray;`, usage =>`background: var(--penguin-skin), black;`
- Declaring CSS variable in root
```css
  :root {
    --penguin-belly: pink;
  }
```

## Day16: 12/4/19
### Today's Progress:
- Solved New Years Chaos from Array section of Interview Prep Kit
### Thoughts:
- I solved the problem successfully but output type causes not all 100% cases to pass
- Found that splice was useful but didn't remove & insert with a for loop
- Note: splice works by how many to remove, slice works by removing up to an index

## Day15: 12/3/19
### Today's Progress:
- Solved Left Rotation from Array section of Interview Prep Kit
- Reviewed Bubble Sort Coding Concept
- Finish the demo short of ejecting, [TypeScript React Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter#typescript-react-starter)
### Thoughts:
- The HackerRank problem was not as difficult as I thought
- Bubble sort makes more sense and still fresh in my mind, naive is more intuitive than refined approach for me
- The typescript demo went into adding redux and it totally blew me away!
- Definitely need to work on a project to familiarize the ecosystem: Typescript, Redux, React Router

---
## Day12: 11/30/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked on Warm-up Challenges: Repeated String
### Thoughts:
- This was a tough one due to all the edge cases and JS loose typing
- I used RegExp `string.match(/a/g)` to check for all cases
- The problem lies in if it returns `null` if none are found
- Therefore, one has to put a `OR` operator before taking the length
- Otherwise you will get can't read length of null error
- IE `(s.match(/a/g) || []).length`

---
## Day11: 11/29/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked on Warm-up Challenges: Jumping on the Clouds
### Thoughts:
- I figured doing a while loop through the end is most efficient
- As it progresses, it checks if it can jump 2 times first, then 1
- I would ask further in an interview if they want me to check any edge cases

## Day10: 11/28/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked on Warm-up Challenges: Counting Valleys
### Thoughts:
- This challenge seemed hard at first but the solution was more simple than I had originally thought
- I thought I would have to keep track of the time it goes down, then make sure the ascent number equals out
- All I had to do was check the sea level and the ascent direction is up
- You'll understand if you look at my cold

## Day9: 11/27/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked on Warm-up Challenges: Sock Merchant
### Thoughts:
- I had a difficult time at first since I didn't think of sorting the input first
- Once it's sorted, it's easy to determine the number of matching socks
- This is good practice because HackerRank makes you think from different angles

## Day8: 11/26/19
### Today's Progress:
- Finished day 10 and completed "10 Days of Javascript" on HackerRank
- Went through [Typescript's 5 minute tutorial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html)
### Thoughts
- The calculator javascript code wasn't as difficult
- I remember in the past that using eval() method was easy but unsecure
- This was just a matter of splitting the numbers and operation sign, converting to binary, then do the operation, and converting back to base-10
- Typescript seems easy with the tutorial but I need to explore further
- I'd like to practice more emmet abbreviations as well > [Useful Cheatsheet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/)

## Day7: 11/25/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked through "10 Days of Javascript" on HackerRank, day 9
- Implemented display to show numbers when clicked on button
- Not finished yet

## Day5: 11/23/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked through "10 Days of Javascript" on HackerRank, day 7
- Read through articles about regular expressions
### Thoughts
- Define regex pattern by setting to a new variable or use `new RegExp(/pattern/flags)`
- Regex literal:`const re = /\d+/g`
- Regex object: `const re = new RegExp('\\d+', 'g')`
- A character class is used in brackets to define one or more characters (Use ., \d, \D, \w, \W, \s, \S)
- Boundaries are used to set limits around the string (Use ^, S, \b, \B)
- RegExp methods (test, exec) or string methods (match, search, split, replace)
- Capturing groups use parentheses and remembers the match
- use `\1` to backreference the first capture group
- See [article](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-regexp-1/topics/javascript-regex)
