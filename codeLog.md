## Day17: 12/5/19
### Today's Progress:
- Solved New Years Chaos from Array section of Interview Prep Kit
- Finished "Basic CSS" section of Responsive Web Design Certification
### Thoughts:
- Algorithm was confusing initially but I wrote it out on paper
- It started making more sense and I wrote this algorithm accordingly
- `indexOf` takes a second argument to start searching from second argument
- `indexOf` returns the first matching index which the element can be found (IE string, number), or else returns -1
- EXAMPLE: `array.indexOf('bison')`
- `findIndex` returns the first matching index in array matching the condition, or else returns -1
- EXAMPLE: `array.findIndex(item => item > 13)`
- Learned CSS variables: declartion => `--penguin-skin: gray;`, usage =>`background: var(--penguin-skin), black;`
- Declaring CSS variable in root
```css
  :root {
    --penguin-belly: pink;
  }
```

## Day16: 12/4/19
### Today's Progress:
- Solved New Years Chaos from Array section of Interview Prep Kit
### Thoughts:
- I solved the problem successfully but output type causes not all 100% cases to pass
- Found that splice was useful but didn't remove & insert with a for loop
- Note: splice works by how many to remove, slice works by removing up to an index

## Day15: 12/3/19
### Today's Progress:
- Solved Left Rotation from Array section of Interview Prep Kit
- Reviewed Bubble Sort Coding Concept
- Finish the demo short of ejecting, [TypeScript React Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter#typescript-react-starter)
### Thoughts:
- The HackerRank problem was not as difficult as I thought
- Bubble sort makes more sense and still fresh in my mind, naive is more intuitive than refined approach for me
- The typescript demo went into adding redux and it totally blew me away!
- Definitely need to work on a project to familiarize the ecosystem: Typescript, Redux, React Router

## Day14: 12/2/19
### Today's Progress:
- Array section of Interview Prep Kit: 2D Array - DS
- Worked on [TypeScript React Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter#typescript-react-starter)
- Researched about speech-to-text and translation APIs
### Thoughts:
- Finally solved the 2d Array problem
- Learned how to work with 2D arrays in JS
- See this helpful [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/966225/how-can-i-create-a-two-dimensional-array-in-javascript)

## Day13: 12/1/19
### Today's Progress:
- Started on Array section of Interview Prep Kit
- Working on problem "2D Array - DS"
### Thoughts:
- Attempted make sense of the problem
- It's complex and I'm still working on it

## Day12: 11/30/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked on Warm-up Challenges: Repeated String
### Thoughts:
- This was a tough one due to all the edge cases and JS loose typing
- I used RegExp `string.match(/a/g)` to check for all cases
- The problem lies in if it returns `null` if none are found
- Therefore, one has to put a `OR` operator before taking the length
- Otherwise you will get can't read length of null error
- IE `(s.match(/a/g) || []).length`

## Day11: 11/29/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked on Warm-up Challenges: Jumping on the Clouds
### Thoughts:
- I figured doing a while loop through the end is most efficient
- As it progresses, it checks if it can jump 2 times first, then 1
- I would ask further in an interview if they want me to check any edge cases

## Day10: 11/28/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked on Warm-up Challenges: Counting Valleys
### Thoughts:
- This challenge seemed hard at first but the solution was more simple than I had originally thought
- I thought I would have to keep track of the time it goes down, then make sure the ascent number equals out
- All I had to do was check the sea level and the ascent direction is up
- You'll understand if you look at my cold

## Day9: 11/27/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked on Warm-up Challenges: Sock Merchant
### Thoughts:
- I had a difficult time at first since I didn't think of sorting the input first
- Once it's sorted, it's easy to determine the number of matching socks
- This is good practice because HackerRank makes you think from different angles

## Day8: 11/26/19
### Today's Progress:
- Finished day 10 and completed "10 Days of Javascript" on HackerRank
- Went through [Typescript's 5 minute tutorial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html)
### Thoughts
- The calculator javascript code wasn't as difficult
- I remember in the past that using eval() method was easy but unsecure
- This was just a matter of splitting the numbers and operation sign, converting to binary, then do the operation, and converting back to base-10
- Typescript seems easy with the tutorial but I need to explore further
- I'd like to practice more emmet abbreviations as well > [Useful Cheatsheet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/)

## Day7: 11/25/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked through "10 Days of Javascript" on HackerRank, day 9
- Implemented display to show numbers when clicked on button
- Not finished yet
### Thoughts
- I tried adding click event listeners after looping through a `querySelectorAll` but didn't work
- End up having to manually attaching an event listener to each selector manually

## Day6: 11/24/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked through "10 Days of Javascript" on HackerRank, day 8
### Thoughts
- It was cool to jump back into some vanilla javascript for once
- The challenges themselves weren't too interesting
mselves weren't toointeresting

## Day5: 11/23/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked through "10 Days of Javascript" on HackerRank, day 7
- Read through articles about regular expressions
### Thoughts
- Define regex pattern by setting to a new variable or use `new RegExp(/pattern/flags)`
- Regex literal:`const re = /\d+/g`
- Regex object: `const re = new RegExp('\\d+', 'g')`
- A character class is used in brackets to define one or more characters (Use ., \d, \D, \w, \W, \s, \S)
- Boundaries are used to set limits around the string (Use ^, S, \b, \B)
- RegExp methods (test, exec) or string methods (match, search, split, replace)
- Capturing groups use parentheses and remembers the match
- use `\1` to backreference the first capture group
- See [article](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-regexp-1/topics/javascript-regex)

## Day4: 11/21/19
### Today's Progress:
- Worked through "10 Days of Javascript" on HackerRank, day 6
- Read through articles about bitwise operators and javascript dates
### Thoughts
- Learned about Bitwise Operators and conversion between binary/decimal
- From decimal to binary, use `(n).toString(2)`
- From binary to decimal, use `parseInt(n, 2)`
- Learn to use `new Date()`, then using `date.getDay()` to get numeral of day of the week
